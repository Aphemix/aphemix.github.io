But then I end up having lots of coffee in the evening sometimes, like when I visited my friend at the cafe. We ended up exchanging coffee for a henna tattoo on her dear friend. So she made me an awesome cafe mocha milkshake. And then just a plain old cafe mocha. That evening I found myself feeling all attracted to a much older guy. A cocky and charismatic one. Go figure. Some people just got it, doesn't matter what age they are when you run into them I guess. I had a lengthy conversation with him, and I was desperately trying not to be flirty, but I'm pretty readable. He could tell. Hahaha! Once I knew he was receptive to it, I avoided him for the rest of the evening. Because I'm all elusive like
that. Jeez, my subconscious does so much of the thinking for me. And then I look back and analyze what was going on, and I'm like "ahh, I see what you did there. Good girl, subconscious."</div><div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">I felt so good about giving this lady a henna tattoo. It was meant to happen. First of all, I ran all the way out to Columbia without accompaniment of my sister, which is not like me. I brought henna. I let my friend know I had henna, and she was so excited, and asked me to give this friend of hers a henna tattoo. This lady I gave a henna tattoo to-- in her late 50's or early 60's. Reminds me so much of Cher. Beautiful, classy woman inside and out. I felt so many good vibes from her. She apparently has been going through a very very rough time, but ever
since her last trip to the hospital, things that she's been thinking have been happening. She wants to see someone, and she runs into them the very next day. She wants to get a henna tattoo, because she can't have a real tattoo with her medical problems, and there I am the next day. And many other things like that. Anyways... I could feel it in the air that we were meant to meet each other. Same energy. And she really needed to hear she had good energy, and I lifted her spirits and affirmed she is in alignment with high spiritual vibration. All that beautiful stuff. I almost started crying as I was telling her. I felt it so strongly. And I just couldn't seem to hug her enough. My friend texted me later that night and said the lady cried over her henna because she was so happy. I am so looking forward to seeing her again. I feel like I lose energy from being around most people, but being around her maximized my energy.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">Oh dear, I need to go get ready. No more typing for me. I must stop myself. Today might just be the most insane day. 5 hours of free face painting at a fair. I'm not even going to put up pictures for the kids to look at. I'm just going to write a list. So I can keep it as simple as I need to. It gets so ugly when I have to cut the line at the end of a "free to the public" kind of event. Like really ugly. I try to remember to have it set for these where I have the last person hold a sign to let everyone know they are the last person, and I give everyone in line ahead of them a numbered
sticker. People always try to butt in line or add to the line somehow. Anyways, I have much to prepare.

<p>don't you know that if your friend had approached me in conversation about her premonitions and her synchronicities, I would have given her strong warnings, rather than encouraging her? You are giving power to something that is dangerous. You need to be careful.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I don't agree with you all the time. I'm sorry I have to tell you things sometimes. I wouldn't do it if it wasn't important that I do it, but it is important that I do it. I am sure you will just do what you want, so meh. Don't hate me.</p>
<p>those kids sound like some real punks. Maybe you could offer them henna tattoos in exchange for their helping set up your stand, so they can do all the labor without your having to pay anyone. Then you can give them their tattoos during your downtime, or when you want to avoid some other unruly customer by looking busy. You can tell them they could've had their tattoos for free, but they ruined it by being assholes.</p>
<p>I don't really know what else to say. I kinda feel like walking around and trying to clear my head or reset my mood. Feel weird and restless. I really enjoyed your last couple of emails though. And I feel privileged that you are still writing me emails even when your weekend is so busy. I feel privileged, but you still owe me a henna tattoo immediately, as soon as you're done working for the day. And hold the voodoo, please. Light on the voodoo.</p>
<p>okay. I'm gonna go fuck off and do whatever I'm doing. Don't shit your dress while you paint kids' faces for free all afternoon. Good luck not shitting your dress. And whatever else you're doing. Whipping your child laborers. Casting spells. Good luck.<br>

I know you told me something you felt really positive about, and all I end up having to say about it is some finger wagging bullshit. I honestly feel like a dickhead every time I do it.</p>
<p>I'm not really worried about persuading you of this or that. I'm more or less already convinced that we will agree sooner or later, and that my wagging my finger at you is no emergency at all. I don't know why I even make a fuss when I already understand the threat I will rub you the wrong way is more relevant than the threat you will cause any serious harm to yourself. It's probably because I am a retard.</p>
<p>those energies and powers are going to get pretty serious soon. Everyone will know what they are, and everyone will confirm them to one another, just like this lady confirmed them to you, and you confirmed them to her. They will resonate with people. It will include all manner of positive emotional reinforcement, it will feel consistent with past experiences. It will be very welcoming, and encouraging, and persuasive, and people will believe these vibes and energies correspond to, I dunno, spiritual integrity, or the approval of the universe, or guidance from their true selves, or what the fuck ever, really. And then these beliefs -- these very strong beliefs, which are confirmed left and right by other people, by experiential data, and by coherent worldview tying all these things together -- these beliefs will enable people to start wielding miraculous powers, miraculous powers like have never before been seen.</p>
<p>just like those miracles in the Bible, performed when a sufficient amount of faith was present -- just like that, but counterfeit, and according to false belief, rather than according to the power of God. That is what will happen. Everyone will believe exactly what is indicated by these powers, and everyone who has not already been made prepared by a knowledge of Jesus Christ and the truth will be lost. This is the very reason my harvest has been prepared: in order that, by the prerequisite settings already configured in their minds, they might be caused to confirm what is false, that a great delusion might overtake the entire earth. I know these things. I know them for sure.</p>
<p>I still don't need to persuade you of anything, but please hear what I am saying. When I wag my finger, I don't just do it to do it, and I don't do it for no reason. Try not to hold my disagreement against me. I speak to you about as delicately as I know how.</p>
<p>I was thinking of you this afternoon, so I decided to send you another email, and, suddenly, this message came out. I don't even know where it came from, really. Oh well. Thanks for hearing me babble.</p>
<p>I hope your day is going okay. I hope mine is going okay, too. I haven't really had shit to do with myself. But Justin wants to hang out with me, now, all of a sudden, and hey, at least there's a dinner today. I don't know.</p>
<p>::shakes off another bizarre mood::</p>
<p>see you!</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Wed, Jul 30, 2014 at 2:45 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><p>meow,</p>
<p>it was very cold last night by the time I laid down to go to bed. I ended up spending the night curled up inside this giant trash bag I've been keeping around for months, which I once used as a poncho, and which I've kept on my person since then for whatever reason, but it barely even guarded me from the wind, and it made a very shitty blanket. It was also about the closest thing I had to a fluffy pillow before I opened it up and used it as a blanket, so I pretty much had to sleep with rocks under my head just so I could use it. On rocks, in a bag. I did not sleep a pleasant sleep at all.</p>
<p>I was at my dinner the other day. Yesterday? I was going up a set of stairs, on my way out of the basement of this building, about to leave, and I remember thinking how obnoxious this woman was as she walked immediately in front of me, saying hi to everyone she passed by or saw, repeatedly delaying my ascent up the steps. I see her reach out and grab somebody's hand, preventing me from passing in front of her, giving the world's most unnecessarily emphatic handshake to someone who, clearly, isn't even very interested in socializing with her in the first place, and all I can think to myself is, like, holy shit, what the fuck is wrong with this bitch? Doesn't she know she's walking in front of somebody in the middle of a staircase? I'm about ready to just walk through her and pretend it was an accident. About ready to just stomp over a human being. Suddenly, though, I look at her face, and I see her lips are frothing, she's staring past me into space, and she's having a seizure while she stands there on her feet, just shaking the shit out of this motherfucker's hand and looking right through me. I'm so flabbergasted at this point I'm just like: dammit, how do I walk past this. Frozen in place. I hear someone screaming about, put her on her side, put her on her side! Nobody's even doing anything. So I put her on her side on the floor, and I walk past her. The end.</p>
<p>gosh, I am suddenly reminded of an even more horrible thing. I meant to tell you about this, but I never did, so I guess I'll just tell you. There was this time a while back, right before I walked to my brother's place before hanging out there for this long stretch this month. I was walking with a few friends, all high as shit on k2. Arguably disabled. Just zombied the fuck out. Suddenly, behind us, we hear this dude talking a LOT of shit to a woman he's walking with. Just degrading the hell out of her; really nasty stuff. So I hear it, and I'm just like: hmm, that sucks. Whatever. Keep walking. But these two are gaining some ground on us, and, as they get closer, I hear the woman making even more frantic noises of resistance, on purpose. Just yelling, wailing, in obvious consideration of our group being within earshot of her. No longer just bitching to the dude, but loudly crying some help me type shit, dying for us to hear her. But we just keep walking. Don't even turn around. Then I hear the dude actually taunting this chick, saying something to her about, oh yeah, nobody cares, nobody's going to help you. And I hear his speech escalate in a way that I felt corresponded to his hitting her, as though he just hit her right there to show her that nobody would do anything and nobody would help her. I believed he hit her, but I didn't know for sure whether he hit her; I couldn't tell. Then, quiet. And we just kept walking. Didn't do shit. I felt really horrible about that for a few days after it happened, and I felt like I definitely would've taken some kind of action if it weren't for my being so freakin' high at the time. But it is what it is. And that's my story.</p>
<p>I just vacated the library in a hurry after some woman sat down next to me and insisted on chatting me up about nothing. She's like 60 years old and I swear she just chit chats with me out of nowhere because she's attracted to me. Does it all the time no matter how disinterested I act. Sometimes I have the patience to engage her in conversation. But not all the time.</p>
<p>now I'm sitting at the next most convenient place to charge a phone, and kids keep coming up and playing this public piano very poorly immediately next to me. It hurts my ears and my mood. Ugh, the outside. All I want to do is escape.</p>
<p>I guess I'm off to go do some other shit. Hope you are well. Talk to you when I talk to you.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Wed, Jul 30, 2014 at 7:16 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>I used the word vigilant today when I meant to say diligent.

<p>somebody told me yesterday that I might be eligible to go back to the shelter I was staying at, as they changed a bunch of things around lately, and a lot of people who had been kicked out are now allowed to go back there. I'm not sure I even care to jump through whatever hoops I'd need to jump through to do it -- aside from freak accident cold evenings like yesterday's, I don't think my quality of life is really any different outside than it was when I stayed there. I dunno. I might check it out tomorrow or something.</p>
<p>I wish I could just land a cushy job or win the fucking lottery or some shit so I could put this chapter of my life behind me already. There is so much more I could be doing with myself than fucking off on the street. It is maddening.</p>

<br></div>I walked to my brother's afterward. I don't even know why I made the walk. I guess it's because I knew he would work during the day today, and that I would get to hang out indoors without any motherfuckers bothering me while he did it. And because I am perpetually restless anyway. I don't know. So I got here around midnight, and my brother proceeds to tell me about, y'know, this and that, blah blah blah, and oh yeah, he and his friend have been doing heroin all week. I don't really know what to say to that. I mean, my input is pretty worthless anyway, even about something much less significant than that, so I guess it doesn't even matter what I say to it.

<p dir=ltr>That is disheartening. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Today I had two cups of hot chocolate coffee. I call them crappaccinos. And two glasses of Coca-Cola. And 3 handfuls of chips. One handful for each meal. I suck at this eating healthy business. At least today I definitely do.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Stayed home all day. No gigs. On a Saturday. Wow. And I can't say I'm complaining either. I needed a day off. One to spend cleaning and finishing projects and all that. The day went by so fast though. And i always do the least important tasks first. I wish I could add on some more time. I don't want to stop tackling my to do list.</p>
<p dir=ltr>But gotta wake up early tomorrow for an event. So I SHOULD get a shower and go to bed. I'm dragging my feet though.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm almost out of business cards. Eek! I want to change them again anyways. I have to make myself wait until I'm completely out of the ones I have now. Because I know me, I'd be so eager to use the new ones, I'd never get rid of the last of the old ones.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I did however order cards with henna tattoo care instructions to give to people when they get henna tattoos. And they have business info on the back so they double as business cards. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I've not been feeling 100% awesome about my character lately. Trying to figure out if I'm beating myself up too much, or if it is just the right balance to keep me humble, or if I seriously need to work hard on improving myself. I see a bit of a snooty, egocentric self emerging. I need to watch myself. Things come out of my mouth that two seconds after I say them I'm thinking "Wow. You are so full of yourself. It is gross. You ho."</p>
<p dir=ltr>Oh looky there, I'm laying in bed and getting all droopy-eyed. Looks like I'm gonna go to sleep without showering and then my future morning self will hate me for not getting that out of the way. </p>

I treated her very well, for the most part. Truly, my love for her transformed me, and in such a way that I could not allow myself to do wrong to her, even despite the many remaining defects of my character. I was very good to her, and I treated her as delicately as I knew how. Indeed, I <i>learned </i>how. I learned more all the time. That is how much I loved her: I loved her so much that my vigilance over that love was <i>constant. </i><br>
<br>Galina was a child. We got along, of course, and I truly held nothing against her, but she was a child. She was egocentric, because she was young. She was perpetually unhappy, because she thought as a young person thinks. She was dependent on her being viewed and treated in a very particular way, you see, and her unhappiness originated from within her own mind. Of course, when I sought to encourage her to maturity, and when I sought to facilitate our conducting ourselves wisely, because I loved her, she interpreted our disagreements as though the discomfort they caused her were reality, and she held them against me. I treated her delicately, surely, but when her feelings did not, she held them against me as though they were my very own actions. Because of this, her feelings toward me grew hopelessly mixed and confused.<br>
<br>eventually, Galina stumbled upon some shit that purported to explain
the conflicting feelings she was experiencing. It explained to her that
she was the victim of a narcissist. It explained that the instances of
her being loved and rightly handled in our relationship were a
predator's deliberate bait, intended to influence her, weaken her defenses, and
ensure her continued compliance to the whims of that predator. It explained that this predator was a terminally deficient and soulless
being, pathologically incapable of having life in himself, and that, in order to even live, it was fundamentally necessary for this predator to deceive and subjugate other people. It explained that the discomfort Galina experienced from our disagreements, and from her not being regarded
as she felt she should be regarded, were completely sensible, and were actually signs of her encountering that predator's aforementioned <i>true
character. </i>Of course, it illustrated these things with description upon description of the very same narcissistic personality I was outgrowing simultaneously to our relationship -- absent the genuinely loving elements of my person, which, granted, were but a subtle nuance, and which any child easily would've missed. I really can't even blame her.<br>
<br>it illustrated these things, and it stressed that the narcissist's illusion was total. It claimed the illusion of his personality could not be distinguished from a regular person's by any means except by the presence of Galina's conflicting emotions and dissatisfaction. It stressed that the victim's emotional investment was the most powerful tool in the narcissist's arsenal, and that, for as long as it existed, the victim's subjugation and devaluation would only continue. It painted a very vivid picture of these things, and it painted this picture procedurally, in order to emphasize its horrid conclusion: the narcissist is not a person. Your feelings about him are manufactured and unreal. Your emotional investment in him is your enemy. The person your feelings correspond to never actually existed. In order to escape and attain to sufficient mental health, you must believe these things completely and "void his image" until absolutely nothing is there. And.... that's exactly what she did.<br>
<br></div>Galina disappeared one day, without a word, and I was left to figure these things out, without so much as a clue or even a suspicion, by myself. This is when I accessed her email account. I <i>had </i>to. And, my goodness, figure it the fuck out I did. It really, really messed me up, too. I couldn't understand what I could've done to get her to that point, but I loved her, and I had no choice but to accept that it had happened. Meanwhile, the things she believed suggested that my pathology would be so pervasive as to be completely unobservable, even to myself, due to my very existence being no more than some persistent delusional fantasy. It sounded terrible, but I realized I could not afford to reject this information. I realized that, were it truthful, my very nature would inhibit me from ever believing it or taking it seriously. I <i>had </i>to address it. I was only just then coming to an adult's understanding of my own person, also, and, just like her, I found my similarity to the narcissist very persuasive. I knew I couldn't risk reasoning myself away from a correct acknowledgment of something so significant and terrible. So I decided I would abandon my own judgment and simply believe the very same things Galina believed.<br>
<br></div>for a long time, I observed myself this way. I observed myself as though my every motivation was the acquisition of further narcissistic resources; as though my every assumption of my own motivation was delusion, and I examined what I saw, looking for confirmation that it was true. And I found confirmation. I found lots of it. I severed contact with every single person in my life. I was utterly convinced that their perceptions only provided me inaccurate data, and that their every approval of my character came as a direct result of their being deceived. I could not afford to rely on their perceptions or incorporate them into my own. I adopted a completely different lifestyle, characterized by my telling the truth on an almost unconditional basis, incriminating my own self as thoroughly as I possibly could. Sabotaging my interactions intentionally. Studying the results that would arise in the behaviors and the perceptions of others. Even performing experiments to test and reproduce what I had seen. I was entirely consumed by my efforts. Everything else was meaningless. Everything else was <i>fodder. </i>Nothing in my life had any use to me at all except by its potential application in helping me excise this disgusting narcissistic pathology from my being. I am not kidding. I went <i>hard. </i><br>
<br>I went so hard that I didn't have a self any more. I was just this <i>process. </i>I wasn't governed by feelings or desires any more. I didn't identify with this or that any more. I was simply machinations, and reactions, and observations of them, and rearrangements of them. I realized it wasn't just me who acted according to delusion. It wasn't just me whose overarching behavior pattern was determined by minute instances of power dynamics and the conditioning of psychological reward mechanisms. It was everyone. <i>Everyone </i>had no self. <i>Everyone </i>was just machinations and interactions between deterministic processes, telling themselves stories and taking credit after the fact, feeling this way or that way and believing it corresponded to some truth. There was no line differentiating me from other people any more. There was just these <i>instances. </i>Interacting with each other. Causing things to happen according to their own settings and configurations, be them in my mind, in someone else's, or in the world. Nothing meant anything. Nothing <i>anyone believed </i>was even <i>real. </i>I didn't exist. I had voided my image. Pinocchio was dead. I locked myself in that box, and I did not come out until I was illuminated consciousness. No joke. That is exactly what I did.<br>
<br></div>Galina got in touch with me again maybe a year after she left me. I think she had heard what I was up to, as I was on some full-blown, <i>I am the underlying force that determines all outcomes, prepare for the imminent eschaton </i>type shit. I don't even remember. I settled down and discovered Christ right around the same time. In any case, we kept in contact, she and I. She was deeply suspicious of me, and she was a fuckin' mess, really, but I still loved her to death. I still wanted what was good for her. So I treated her well, again.<br>
<br></div>for years, we kinda circled around one another, maintaining a close relationship. She lived in Florida, so I never saw her. I was always, always interested in being reconciled to her, maybe dating her again, or, y'know, whatever the sensible thing would be to do, at least. Always. Even when it was untenable, which my new perspective would readily conclude it was -- didn't matter. Still down. She, meanwhile, had the same interest, but only infrequently. More specifically, she suppressed it. She was interested, but it was an interest that could only persist from a certain distance. If we got too close, she would reflexively reject me and reject her interest. She did this because her interest had the propensity to <i>influence </i>her -- and she did not want to be influenced. She had developed an aversion to this influence right around the time she had originally left, you see, and she blamed this influence for her role in our relationship, which hurt her deeply. She did not want to be influenced to be hurt again.<br>
<br></div>our dealings after she got back in touch with me really weren't very much different than they were when we dated. I loved her, so I encouraged her to maturity. I <i>had </i>to. I was a lot more balanced and understanding than I had been, so my approach was even more delicate and even more correct than it was, but when I implicated her, and when I did not view her as she would have me view her, we were enemies. I, of course, <i>wanted </i>to implicate her. I wanted her understanding to be accurate, because that is the only way her aversion would ever be addressed. I wanted her to abandon her distrust of me, which I knew was not warranted. I wanted her to know I loved her, because <i>everything else </i>would've <i>made complete sense </i>if she did. But we just butted heads, instead. Over and over, butting heads, with me intentionally interspersing delicate and harmless interaction between our instances of disagreement, praying, hoping something eventually would work itself out in the long term so long as I didn't disqualify myself by my actions. For years and years, we did this. This is what we did instead of getting back together.<br>
<br></div>last summer, she started chatting with me more intensively amidst some difficult life bullshit she was going through. She had gotten back into drugs, she was dating such-and-such hardened criminal type -- these were normally the types of things she would conceal from me, as their coming up in conversation would put her at risk of my telling her things she didn't want to hear. So we talked, and blah blah blah. She acknowledged a lot, and elucidated a lot, and came to a lot of realizations in our ensuing couple of discussions, as she was quite disturbed by her own behavior and the messes she had gotten herself into. One day, she messaged me, and I guess she had just reached some fucked up point, because she was going on and on about the bullshit situation she was in the middle of, and how she knew better, and how she was never going to make these same mistakes again, and yadda yadda. She told me she finally "got the point," and that it was <i>my </i>point, and that she knew I loved her, and that she knew <i>God </i>loved her, and all this other shit, I dunno. Just a bunch of really surprising declarations I felt would only ever correspond to the true ripening of her soul. I mostly just chilled out and listened, because I didn't have to say anything. She sent me a Facebook friend request, and I had intentionally kept away from her Facebook for years up to this point, as I really couldn't even bear to look at the types of interactions she was having with her peers and so on, but I accepted this one, just because. Then, the very next day, she died suddenly. Just, poof. I thought back to the conversation we had, and I realized I wouldn't have even known that she died were it not for her Facebook page then being visible, and I knew immediately that the Lord had finally given me my resolution, all nice and neat with a little bow on it and everything. It was truly some of the most bittersweet shit that has ever happened to me. Fuckin' hell.<br>
<br></div>I kinda got carried away as I was writing this. I knew I wanted to tell you these things in response to your email, but I didn't know what it would sound like, and I didn't really know what the point was. I still don't. But I hear you. I'm sure I could hear you a lot better -- there's still a lot about your situation that I don't understand, and there's a lot that is hard for me to appreciate, because I'm coming from a different place, and my perspective is a lot different from yours. But I still hear you. I'm not asking you for anything. I'm not <i>trying </i>to, at least. I'm trying <i>not </i>to. I mean, I've been talking to you online since the beginning of the freakin' year, really. It's fine, dude. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. That's my point. We's gravy. It's <i>fine. </i><br>
<div><div><div><br><div>I don't want you to be that girl from your dream. From your story. I don't know who this fuckin' <i>dude </i>was, either, from <i>my </i>story. I won't own up to being him. But holy shit. I would be very, very happy to be even half of that person. You feel me?<br>

It's making me tired. In fact, I took a nap. And now I'm drinking coffee. And catching myself staring blankly at a wall after reading it maybe 5 more times. I think next is another nap.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I can't remember how much I've told you before about Armando. I need to go back and refresh my memory at some point. Or do I even want to, I just don't know. I'm fueling a fire.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I've been feeling really depressed and bothered lately. I'm sure more than half of it is caused by the current subject. And the other half is probably hormones.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Anyways, I have a long day tomorrow. Cake decorating from 8 to 3:30, and face painting from 5 to 8. Just enough time in the middle to change, drive, and set up. And hopefully to pick up food along the way too. So I need to make sure my car is already packed tonight with all the stuff I need.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I may as well visit my grandmother for a bit late tomorrow night too since I'll be so close by her for the event I'm painting at.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm really awkward around my bosses and my coworkers at my new job. Everything I say and do I'm kicking myself over it. I even move differently when I'm there. Like I'm nervous and trying to hide something. I just can't figure it out. And the guys are each all probably getting this heeby jeeby feeling that I have a crush on them. When it is just purely me being anxious and uncomfortable for no explainable reason. I just take longer to adjust to social situations than most people do I guess. Damn I'm awkward. It gets even more awkward when I see that they are misinterpretting my awkwardness. Or maybe they don't think twice about it. Maybe that is the norm for people working together in such a tight space like that for several hours a week. I don't even know. I'm not used to it. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I want to sleep for days. But I definitely can't pull that off. And it wouldn't be a healthy way to deal with things anyways. It would just give me a sore back.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Wednesday, I'm doing henna on the head of a lady who is bald from chemotherapy right now. I'm doing it for free, so she's going to come to my house to have it done. I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I want to go on a health kick soon. I need to have words with my father about it though. He hates it when any of us buy food from a regular grocery store instead of Sharp Shopper or Aldies. Understandably, he wants to save money and thinks it is so wasteful to pay 3 times the price at a grocery store for something that is just a little more fresh. But that's the only way I can foresee succeeding at regularly putting together very healthy, but very perishable meals. Buying a little at a time from the store just down the road instead of buying it in bulk from somewhere further away. I don't know. I do a lot of talking and not a lot of doing. Sounds like I'm ambitious, but maybe I am not so much.</p><font color=#550055>

<p dir=ltr>Armando told me when we first got together that his past girlfriend and his daughter died during childbirth a couple years before.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Months later he mentions his alcoholic aunt and her two kids living in the basement of his family's house with him. Since it was a full house, and they needed someone to take them in. And he took care of her kids for her. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Months later she and the kids moved to west Virginia.</p>
<p dir=ltr>A year later than that there was a family emergency in west virginia that he had to go to and that he couldn't explain right away. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Then the truth that I had feared, that his aunt was really his wife with his two daughters, but with a twist, that she was an evil psycho bitch that started dating his uncle after realizing Armando had amnesia that completely wiped out all memory of her beyond the time that he was lead to believe she died of childbirth because her family hated him. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Obviously that was to the point of pure stupid as hell bullshit. But with his skillful delivery, and my outstanding denial, I clung as hard as I could onto believing that he was a good person and loved me as I loved him.</p>
<p dir=ltr>So I hung out for 2 more years. And that is one of many many many lies that he upheld as truth to the very end.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I think I saw him 5 times in the last year. Because shit hit the fan. I cried myself to sleep every night. Didn't know how i would make it through to the next day, beyond clinging on to the promise he would make every week that he was trying his best to come see me. That he had to work every second of every day, or be looking for extra work, to pay for child support. That he was constantly afraid that he'd get thrown in jail for always being behind on it, and how that horrible ex of his spent all the money on herself and didn't take care of the children. And that when he was free he would have these medical phenomenon migraines that made him unfit to drive. He always made himself out to be this hero, with the whole world against him, as he was trying to rebuild our relationship. That I just had to wait a little bit longer, and everything would be okay again. We'd get through it. And that I shouldn't pry, because he was doing his best and
it already hurt him enough to know that he hardly got to see me, that I was just rubbing it in every time I tried to actually make it happen. Unless of course, if I was 'spotting' him the money that he could possibly be making that night if he didn't stop to see me.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Then my sister found the pictures online of him and mar (the other "slave" he lived with, who paid for all the rent and groceries for him with her college money, and then some) with two new girls. And by new, they were with them for longer than a year. That last year, he was fucking those 3. And you know, me. 5 times. From behind. Because he knows it is impossible for me to get pleasure that way beyond the pleasure of knowing he was enjoying my body.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Denial. Stupidity. Love. Devotion. Submission. Emotional dependence. In a nutshell. That's actually not even half of the nutshell. Not even a quarter. There is no nutshell. I'm reminding myself why it's better to not remind myself.</p>

didn't want me to drink it. I found it immediately upon waking up and
proceeded to have my morning coffee as usual. This afternoon, he came
back from work, mentioned the coffee, and procured it from its hiding
place, intending to make some for himself. I could tell he was
suspicious I had taken some, and he asked me about it on his way to the
coffee machine. But when he got there, he saw that I had left the
machine full of water, and he determined that, after discovering the
coffee was absent, I had aborted making a pot of coffee halfway through,
explaining the water left in the machine. He chided me and poked fun at
me when he saw it. His suspicion disappeared, and I laughed heartily in
secret.

have you ever heard of duping delight? It is a term that describes
the amusement a deceiver experiences upon having his lies or
misdirections successfully accepted as truths. It may be applied
elsewhere, for all I know, but I've only ever heard it mentioned in the
context of psychopathy. It's a fairly common term, in recent times,
actually, what with motherfuckers going apeshit left and right about
this CEO and that world leader is a psychopath, grasping at straws. That
may have even been how I first learned it. I don't know.<br><br>in any
case, while I, myself, do not display all symptoms of clinical
psychopathy -- indeed, I believe psychopathy as a condition to be quite
unlike its clinical descriptions, and mine most of all -- I do
experience duping delight. It's a funny little thing. It tickles me. It
hits the same spot as when I do something funny or clever. I mean, I
don't go around preying on people, and I try to lie as little as
possible, really, so it's not exactly a significant fixture in my life.
But every so often I will do something small. Like this coffee machine
thing. Why? I don't know why. Because I'm an asshole, probably. Maybe I like just holding the truth over somebody else's head. But I dunno. It amuses me. So long as it's
harmless, it amuses me.<br><br></div>for the record, I could tell my brother about this at any time, and he would probably just laugh. There is enough coffee remaining to last another couple of pots at least, and I plan on letting my brother shop for some things when my food stamps come on tomorrow, so I know it doesn't matter what I did. I will probably bring it up at some point later today.<br>

sensible, and what is sensible is the same thing as what is preferable. I am teaching you. You don't need to worry about anything. The days are set in their place.<br><br></div>you didn't really cut me. Actually, you did, a little. But it was worth it.<br>

Shows how selectively I pay attention, I guess. I don't really know very much about the book to begin with, but I've picked up bits and pieces from the talking points the TV would mention, back when the book was a popular and a contentious thing, and I also picked up other bits and pieces by questioning friends I've seen bring it up in conversation. I don't know much about the storyline of the book, as I've determined that part to be irrelevant and have probably forgotten everything I learned, but the book itself seems to be a really comprehensive propaganda piece that presents psychologically manipulative and vampiric relationships as normal, while also detailing in great depth the functionalities and causative mechanisms of those relationships, like a user manual. I consider the book but one medium of many by which psychopathic consciousness is subtly being cultivated in the mind and personality of the average person. I am not at all surprised that it is being adapted into a movie on this basis.<br>

It likely reached its peak well before your time. Personally, I grew up with the Ninja Turtles. I used to watch the cartoon, like, every weekday, in grade school; I had a collection of action figures; all that shit. Same with all my peers. I've always been a fan.<br>
<br></div>the other day, I was browsing the web, and, by chance, I discovered there was some new TMNT comic published recently that reinterpreted the lore of the franchise and the origins of its characters, and the comic was very well-received by fans. I saw a few pictures of the comic, and I thought the illustration style was pretty neat. The prospect of the comic series seemed interesting, and it was only a short four issues in total, so I went and downloaded a torrent of all of them, and I read the whole thing in probably fifteen or twenty minutes.<br>
<br></div>I don't even know how to explain to you the ridiculousness of this comic without your having a corresponding understanding of the backstory of the franchise. I tried to explain it to my brother, who knows all about the Ninja Turtles, but he has little understanding of the things I was getting at when I told him, so he didn't really appreciate it. In any case, the comic took what I previously thought to be some harmless lore, and it twisted it into this crazy thing, where the villains get their powers and their technology from their contact with the spirit realm, where the main villain is reinterpreted as being the living embodiment of some intrinsic force of nature whose time has now come, where the Turtles get their heroes' strength from Eastern mysticism, and reincarnated souls, and being more highly-evolved than humans.... it's just <i>so </i>fucking ridiculous and overt. Then to top it all off, I realize each of these elements I found alarming actually has its origins in the original telling of the story, albeit while being much more thoroughly obscured. Sometimes I can't help but just look at this stuff and <i>laugh. </i><br>
<br></div>would you be surprised if I told you I look back nostalgically and find unmistakably clear encouragement toward illumination, and the occult, and psychopathic consciousness, in practically every single fixture of my life going back to my childhood? Probably not. Probably not.<br>

I mean, I do, I guess, but I also have a broader understanding that everything is in its right place. I am saddened when I see a deceived person, and when I see a person who seems hopeless according to how he is deceived, especially, but I know that it is not by the power of these deceptions that a person ends up in hopeless positions, and that, rather, a person's receptivity to deception is a symptom of his person, which can change, and which does not rely on understanding to be changed.<br>
<br></div>look at you, for example. Look at how you respond to me. Consider your wariness in comparison to that of another person, another person who would trust me completely. A lack of understanding of my motives and my actions may explain a person trusting me, but it is not your understanding of those motives and actions that causes you to be suspicious. You're just suspicious because something happened to you. You're suspicious because you care to be rightly informed, and you don't care because of your superior information, you care because of your experiences and your feelings. I could be the devil right now, and, hypothetically speaking, you might escape. You didn't have to understand my tricks correctly, or recognize that all my tricks were tricks, to escape. You just had to want to. It's like that.<br>

My need to socialize is pretty minimal, so it ends up being pretty efficiently taken care of simply by my going along with the preferences of other people. Someone calls me? Someone comes up to me on the street? My brother wants to invite friends over? Cool, I'm set. Don't even need to do anything. I tend to exercise my own initiative to <i>avoid </i>social interactions more than I even do to organize them. Otherwise, it's like I don't even need it.<br>
<br></div>do you have any online relationships? I chat to a few people here and there, myself. I post on this site or that site. Not very much, but some. Kinda helps me regulate my head and work some bullshit out. Load distribution. Something. I don't know.<br>
<br></div>I feel quite alone. A lot of times, even the interactions I do have are useless to me. It's like -- okay, I can play with my dog. I can enjoy my dog's company. I can appreciate my dog's personality. I can even use my relationship with my dog to facilitate things like my going outside, or my exercising, or my keeping to a schedule, or my being affectionate, or I don't fucking know, whatever. But these are by far the most rewarding interactions I can have with the dog. My dog doesn't talk to me. My dog doesn't know shit about me. My dog can't really do much of anything except dog things and whatever else I tell her to do. So I train the dog. I show the dog new things. I mess with the dog. I trigger very particular behavior in the dog by subjecting the dog to very precise and variant circumstances, so I can drink up the last of the dog's quirks like a desperate drop of water in the desert. But the dog is just the dog. I feel quite alone.<br>

And
you're allowed to give me shit, if you want; don't get me wrong. But
please don't believe that my not trying is the single determining factor
in my failure to get my shit together. That is a <i>very </i>demeaning way to
look at me. I mean, I concede; I am guilty. You're allowed to give me
shit. You get a free pass. But I'm not <i>that </i>guilty.<br><br>homelessness is <i>very hard. </i>I swear it's hard. You're so welcome to take to the street with me if you don't believe me. And there has been no shortage of extenuating circumstances, even extenuating circumstances I would swear were intelligently designed to <i>fuck my shit up </i>and artificially determine the parameters of my life. I really believe this. I do. Not to mention I have excuse upon excuse I probably invented, on top of that. I am expert mode, after all. But yeah. I dunno; who cares.<br>
<br></div>my day was mostly uneventful in a way that was mostly pleasant. I downloaded the crappiest imaginable cam version of this new movie "Lucy" this afternoon, about, I dunno, some chick developing psychic powers, implicating the future of the world, illuminating mankind, blah blah blah -- some shit I pretty much only cared to watch for the sake of masturbating my spidey sense. I went through some really old artifacts from my teenage years that I've left here at my family's house since originally living here, nearly all of which were embarrassing to the point of being nauseating, even despite my being alone as I looked at them. Some "autobiography" I was tasked to write when I was incarcerated as a juvenile stuck out to me in particular, as it was almost all absurdly fictional material designed to draw particular types of attention to myself, having almost no bearing on reality at all. I envisioned sharing it with you as I read it. I tried to identify what real-world circumstances inspired my tall tales as I read it, like a memory game. I thought to myself about my tactics: fucking amateur.<br>
<br></div>somebody really wanted that shit on his head?

It was my first time even being at the park. The park was something of a drug hotspot, and I didn't do any drugs at all, so I really wasn't the typical person you would expect to find at this park, by any measure. <br>
<br>suddenly, as I'm here minding my business, I see this man and wife couple stroll up next to me. It was my first time seeing them for long while. I had met this man and wife in unrelated circumstances: they were Christians I had struck up conversation with upon seeing their attempting to evangelize to the local homeless population elsewhere. The wife approaches me. She tells me the Holy Spirit specifically told her to come to that spot to look for me in particular, and that he had a message for me: open your Bible, she says. That's it. I'm just like: what the shit? Did that really happen?<br>
<br></div>I never opened my Bible. I was too lazy. I was unmotivated. It was at the bottom of my bag full of junk and my head really just wasn't in the right place to commit to reading my Bible or even care to. The very next day, I'm doing such and such, whatever. I abandon my backpack for the first time since I've been homeless -- in the most roundabout and remote location I could've possibly conceived, for a very brief window of time, and only as a result of my suddenly having to deal with some shit that required I didn't carry my bag. I come back for the bag and it's gone. Along with my Bible. My <i>dad's </i>Bible, actually, which I valued a <i>lot. </i>And, of course, everything else I owned, too. My clothes. My ID card and SS card. All my shit, poof.<br>
<br>things like that. Extenuating circumstances.
