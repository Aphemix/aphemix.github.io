So. Ugh. I'm tiiiiiiiired. I napped. I napped hard. I scrambled to get done with as much as I could at work today thinking that I had to be done by 2:30 in order to be ready for the makeup/body paint that I was supposed to be doing at 4. But the plans got canceled in a facebook message at 9 this morning and I was unaware.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div>Normally I'd be pretty irked by a last minute cancelation done that way, but holy monkeys, I am so tired.

Dang, he takes so much care of me. He knows
I wouldn't have eaten if he hadn't have offered to make me food. I'm a mess. I have a pattern of forgetting to eat and then getting sick. Either from being majorly depressed or anxious, or majorly excited, or majorly tired. I'm always majorly something, it seems. But yeah. He loves me. We had a nice sit-down lunch visit. He had me try apricot brandy he just got. I didn't like it. I dumped my little shot into a glass of soda.

trying to do this thing where I get shit done and then reward myself with an email. Which is why you didn't hear from me RIGHT when I got home, or RIGHT after I woke up from my nap. It's difficult. I've been itching to. And you know, I haven't gotten that much done since I woke up from my nap. But hey, enough for me to justify the reward! That way if I see you respond to this one, I've got another motivator to keep me doing more shit before I can look at it! Gonna tackle at the mess of strings to tie little by little. And eventually the hope is that I will catch up. And then I will breathe easier, and feel better.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div>I think I should do this with yummy food too.

Drink free coffee? I didn't event realize that was a thing! Like... I didn't know every mcdonalds was doing that. I didn't get it when you mentioned it, but I figured it was some circumstance to do with Lancaster or.. I don't know. I've never heard of it before. My mother brought up about McDonalds
doing free small coffees. So now I realize it's a thing. BUT WHY? I mean, awesome. Is it for the week, or the month, or what?</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">Awwww, Danielle. You think she likes you, or you think she likes getting your attention? Or both? D'awww. Poor dear. But hey. Y'know. Nice to be in the presence of boobs? I always like to be in the presence of boobs. Unless they belong to someone actively being all obnoxious and skanky and loud, flirting with a bunch of guys purely for attention.
But really, that's just entirely the skanky flirting that I don't like being in the presence of. The boobs are still nice. And sometimes I think the person themselves are nice, just not when surrounded with guys and doing their thing. But. Whatever. Point is. Everybody loves boobs.</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">Especially Renaissance Faire people. Renaissance Faire People love their boobs.</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">My sister visited Renaissance Faire with her friend, and they were going on one of the man-powered rides they have there. And she overheard them talking about how they could never date anyone from Renaissance Faire, because the people there are all just not dating material. All cheaters or crazy or whatever. Something along that theme. My sister jumped in and told them "Yeah, my sister found that out the hard way when she dated a guy here." And they asked his name. And they knew who he was, and told her he had pretty much slept with every girl at faire. And that they knew he
was with Mar officially, and that they suspected there was a third, and that she had just confirmed it for them. The first of course, being his wife that I knew nothing about. I was horrified to hear this being recalled to me. And I'll never know if it is true or not about him sleeping with a bunch of other people there. But it's over. Damn it, I can't get over how they are gone from my life without a trace. The hair stands up on the back of my neck whenever they are brought up. Or even when someone brings up Millersville, or massage therapists, or martial arts, or &nbsp;Denny's, or whatever. I still find myself imagining running into one of them, or hearing from one of them, or seeing them in the news or on a website or anything. Like to confirm they exist. As if I wonder if they aren't even real.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">I can tell where I'm at just because of the songs I am responsive to when I'm driving along in my car. Like, I generally feel like I'm not thinking about it at all. But then one of the songs that's about being angry or lost about someone cheating or lying or whatever comes on. And I blast that shit and sing along at the top of my lungs. I'da thought I'd get sick of that by now. But I still feel the same way. I wanna run into them so I can roast their faces with my laser death-glare. Or melt their pride with my unwavering rays of sunshine. One or the other.</div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue','Segoe UI',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">See, yeah, I'm still not approaching that whole getting over it thing from the right angle.

Hahahaha.</p>
<p>I almost did wet my pants. I got spooked, at least. I felt my stomach drop for a second. Then I got a text, and I felt it happen again. Was that you? I don't know who else it would be. But I seem to have lost the ability to even read the first few characters of a text message any more, making the guessing of their origins much more difficult.</p>
<p>I do still try to guess based on the time of day, any potentially related occurrences that could explain one person's text sooner than another's, the frequency with which I receive multiple messages, and so on. I am sick about my guessing.</p>
<p>I only just now looked over my shoulder. Why? I don't know why. I am in a rather public location, though. It is not inconceivable that you could have snuck up on me -- except for the small detail of your being a scaredy cat, at least. I must say, though, I would be quite amused if you did sneak up on me sometime. It would tickle me very much.</p>
<p>what weird shit did I do today? I don't even remember, really, so it probably wasn't very interesting. I fucking lost Hitler's backpack, for one! I felt so freakin' terrible when I did it. I stashed it somewhere I safely stash my own bag all the time, but I only stashed it because I was being lazy. I could've left it at Danielle's place, too -- I even brought it there, intending to do it, when I went. I kept it with me, instead, though, because I anticipated that Hitler would be out and walking around the street again by this afternoon, and I didn't want to inconvenience the guy by not having it. But whoops. Now I don't have it. Fuck.</p>
<p>I ran into this guy's girlfriend by herself today. This guy and girl couple's girlfriend. She got my attention on purpose and flirted with me hardcore. I admit: I rolled with it. I am a flirtatious fellow. It's how I get my foot in the door all the time. We parted ways, though, and without anything noteworthy really having happened beyond my just being amused privately at how bad she was coming onto me.</p>
<p>she is pretty. She's almost ten years older than me. It gave me a little confidence boost like your email gave me a little spook. But I felt guilty even about being in the position, harmless as it was. You own my heart. You do. Don't forget.</p>
<p>I played with some little kid for like a half hour while I was waiting in my dinner line earlier this evening. I love this kid. He's pretty much cooler than anyone else I hang out with. I took a few pictures of him playing with my pocket Bible like it was a toy. He creeped up on me while I was reading it, and he played with it the whole time. It was cute as shit, but the pictures don't really capture it.</p>
<p>there was a point where I was being "attacked" by these two kids at the same time. That is: this kid, and another, older one, who was with the first one, ganged up on me out of nowhere, playing. Suddenly, the first kid's mom sees him here doing whatever he's doing, yanks him off of me, and gives him a harsh smack right in his face, accusing him of having bitten me, or played too rough with me, or something. I have no idea what he actually did. A second person claimed to have seen him bite me. I didn't notice. I wanted to slap his mom. But instead, I just comforted the kid with sympathetic looks as he was crying, and I played with him again. It was cool. Kids are awesome. They are like puppies. It is easy to love them.</p>
<p>I am sure that you are still very resentful about your relationship with Armando. But thinking about your hoping to resolve something by confronting him upon seeing him ties my stomach up in knots. I want you to know that I would advise you very, very strongly against doing that, and it would bother me if you did. If I was with you and he happened to appear, I would insist on handling it. I would insist, and I know I would be on edge the whole time, because I know that your every move, and your attention span's every move, would be further complicating the entire thing throughout, and very likely without your knowledge. It would be very strenuous and troublesome juggling to me, and you would step on my feet. I know it might sound silly that I think in such depth about such things, and I'm sorry if it is offensive to you. But I swear I wouldn't put it there if it didn't belong there.</p>
<p>I wonder if I have taken long enough writing this email for you to have done something productive? I must admit I kinda stretched it out on purpose as I plotted in my mind how I would write it, trying to be considerate to your needs. I definitely do want to hear from you all the time, in case you were wondering. I don't care what it is, I just want, want, want. But I don't blame you for developing the approach you have developed, either, and I'm glad you are exercising some self-control where it is useful to you.</p>
<p>hi. Hi hi hi hi.</p>
<p>this is the slowest fucking ambush ever.</p>

<p>you definitely do have me in the bag. You had me in the bag from day one. This is what I do from inside the bag. It's your bag! I can do nothing.</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. There is a solid foundation. It's as solid as it gets. And it's predictable, too. Very much so. But your proximity is not the reason you can't predict it. Your distance is the reason. Your lack of experiential reference point is the reason! But it's fine, and all of this delights me very much. I so very much enjoy escorting you where you are going. I will only enjoy it more.</p>
<p>why the homeless psychopath, you ask? Why not this or that? I don't know the answer in its entirety. But, personally, rather than emphasize the relevance of any potential disqualifiers, I instead choose to view the presence of these qualities as a very, very precise filtration mechanism, which has filtered something very, very valuable. That is to say: whatever remains despite the existence of these prohibitive factors is sure to be very pure indeed, having no dependence on any extraneous element or ulterior motive at all. Do you think this is an accident? Do you think it is an accident I have told you so much ridiculous truth, and you have survived? Look at who you are talking to. Is it an accident? Huff puff, motherfucker! Your house is still standing. I want that house. And so do you. You're welcome.</p>

<p>you want a red flag? You want a reason to disqualify me? You should look at my fucking feet, yo. I have such blisters on these fuckers it's crazy. I pretty much walk with a limp. I am disabled. I would take a picture, but really, I don't even want to. Plus, I would probably cause a panic if I exposed them in public. Someone would call the cops. My poor feet.</p>
<p>vaguely related: I learned, since last bringing up the subject, that Hitler, apparently, exposed his junk in public during his recent freakout, and, as a result, will be facing something a little more severe than a simple overnight stay in the police station or whatever. I don't know any more details, but I haven't seen the guy where I would otherwise expect to, so I can pretty safely assume by now that the shit is true. Sucks to be him, but, on the other hand, I know it will soften the blow of my losing all his shit. I still feel irresponsible, just the same, but, on the other hand, I am convinced that the actual harm experienced is now much more negligible. So, good for me, I suppose.</p>
<p>I hung out at Danielle's again for a little chunk of my morning today. She took it easy on the titties, but there were still some subtle attempts to provoke me to sexual interest here and there. I think my revised and final assessment of the behavior is that her trying to entice me sexually, rather than being an extension of some elaborate campaign against her man, is instead just a manifestation of the same underlying pathology by which she is drawn to disrupt her relationships with both him and myself, separately. I know she has a history of having been attracted to me, but I don't think she even wants me so much as she just wants to experience stability and adequacy by way of testing her environments and interactions with various stressors. Human beings, yo. They crazy.</p>
<p>so, off you go to your thing. I am sure I will not even hear from you until this evening. Oh well. Here is an email for your enjoyment. Be well dear.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Wed, Sep 24, 2014 at 9:42 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:16px"><div><span>Oh yep, that's definitely a deal breaker.

<p>I dealt with my feet. They're cool now. I had someone try and scare me earlier today about the risk of infection if I were to pop them, and I was apprehensive, because, dammit, my socks are a fucking dangerous place, and I know it. But I had to do it anyway, especially once you came at me with some not talking to me any more type shit. The threat is real!</p>
<p>you had a long day. I don't blame you for sleeping at all. Take it easy! You have shit to do! I am not going anywhere.</p>

<p dir=ltr>Something all too glorious happened this evening that I must tell you about before I fall asleep. My entertainer friend. I told him about the other entertainer guy bothering me with the texts and the calls and the voice recording and all that. </p>
<p dir=ltr>So my friend texted me at 8ish saying he was at the parade and a guy asked if he and his family could sit in the space next to him. It was THE guy. They have met before, but the guy has no idea that my friend knows me. </p>
<p dir=ltr>And my friend sent me a snapchat of a stealthily taken picture of the guy with his girlfriend. I laughed my ass off. And then my jaw dropped at how awesome God is for lining that up. Because even more into the backstory, this guy told me 3 days ago that his girlfriend left him for another man. It has clearly been confirmed to be untrue. And my friend didn't know that part. So that was just kind of cool how he sent me a picture as proof they were still together while being completely unaware of that lie thrown in the mix 3 days ago. </p>

One for almost every color, since very little blush rinsing can be done in the tiny cup of water in the palette. Anyways. It is definitely a work in progress. It went well for weeusables. Other things for me to take note on... my hand holding the palette was cramping after 2 hours. Aaaand the fingers on my painting hand got dirty, and I could not tend to them with my other hand. Sooo. But anyways! I made a good bit of kids happy. But not the friendliest environment, because a lot of the parents were stand-offish and didn't know what to think of me, and said no
right away thinking I wanted money or whatever. Which, I get it. Location, location, location.

I have filled my daily quota of your presence. I could talk to you forever, but even a little is cool. Knowing you are there is cool. Just touching base and connecting a little bit is enough. Particularly in the evenings: I only stay up so I can talk with you and reciprocate your own energy, mostly. I am always ready to lay down as soon as you disappear.</p>
<p>a story, you say? Goodness. I'm not sure I even have any stories today. Do I?</p>
<p>I saw the chick who bashed my one friend with a fire extinguisher and my other with a 40 bottle. Earlier today, I saw her. I got her attention casually, and I just told her in an encouraging tone: stay out of trouble! She looked so sad and incriminated. It was kinda horrible. I took such a minimal approach because I pretty much already understood that was all I could really do. But it stuck.</p>
<p>she and I were never close. But I saw her again at McDonald's this evening. She was bitching pretty aimlessly about her problems and her frustrations, and I reached out to her on purpose. I counselled her some, and she let me. Told me all about this and that thing bothering her. I gave her some more encouragement. Anything useful I could think to produce, I produced. She was appreciative, and thanked me. I could tell I mellowed her out and improved her day.</p>
<p>sometimes, rather than hold someone accountable, it's good to just let the understanding I can hold someone accountable hang there, unacknowledged, and just never do it. Never do it, but do good, instead. People are fucking crazy, yo. Dealing with them is crazy.</p>
<p>I'm glad you like hearing me. It makes me happy. It makes me enthusiastic. It makes me excited that I exist. Straight up.</p>
<p>I could go for a late night snack myself. Three dollars on my food stamps. To walk to the store, or not to walk to the store? Hmmm.<br>

<p>I woke up sick today. I have a coarse sore throat and the beginnings of a phlegm cough. I may also have a fever, as I can feel my perceived body temperature fluctuating unusually. I could feel it coming on before I even laid down last night, but it's definitely getting worse. I had something similar diagnosed as acute bronchitis two years ago or so after eventually going to the ER for it when it refused to go away. It was the most terribly sick I've ever been in my life. I hope it is not something so miserable this time.</p>
<p>I got in line to escape the obnoxious sounds of the people immediately surrounding me. My patience for others is definitely significantly reduced at present. Noises I would otherwise tune out and ignore are making my head hurt. The most basic of commotion is leaving me unsettled and confused. Ugh. I should not be smoking cigarettes. But I'm about to smoke one anyway.</p>
<p>thank you for your email and for its vibe. I know I don't even need to tell you, but I definitely care a lot and am rather invested in how our situation develops. Having a bunch of variables and potential outcomes all on the table at the same time has the capacity to really mess with my shit, and that is a lot of why I was reeling after seeing you yesterday and being left to decode what had even happened. But as usual, the solution is just more information. In this case, in the form of your vibe. So I'm glad. I'm glad it doesn't sound like a fuck you sort of vibe. I don't know. I am a weird one.</p>
<p>coffee time. Hope your birthday parties don't drive you too crazy. You're awesome. See you.</p>

<p>my sickness isn't really that bad, but the persistent sore throat and the sensitivity to light and noise have been pretty crappy to deal with all throughout. I've been some shade of disoriented all day, and especially when out in the sun or exerting myself walking. I haven't been too irritable, surprisingly, but a lot of it is just my forcefully having avoided any crowded or oppressive circumstance that could prompt me to become irritated. I still kinda feel like I'm on the verge of losing my shit if someone unattentive to my mood approaches me with a conversation I don't care about. Despite this, my day hasn't felt particularly bad or anything. Not bad at all. Just long.</p>

But I'm glad you aren't any more sick than that. And I'm glad you strategically kept yourself from bumping into annoying people or circumstances.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Feel better!</p>
<p dir=ltr>I feel like a zombie right now. Ready to fall asleep. Ugh.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I had a banana and chips ahoy cookies for breakfast.<br>
At the end of the first party, they fed me pizza and soft pretzel sticks. They are a very wealthy family. Second time with them. They give awesome tips. That makes me a happy camper. And one of the guests booked me and gave me a deposit for a birthday party 2 weeks from now. So two weeks from now, birthday party in Baltimore Maryland. Woot woot!</p>
<p dir=ltr>And then the end of the second party, they fed me Spanish rice and meatballs and fried chicken and some kind of macaroni salad and cake.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I encountered some seriously self-centered, pouty children today. Luckily for me, I'm patient as hell. Lol</p>
<p dir=ltr>And I got a phone call this morning. Continued haggling from an initial attempt a month ago to get me to paint faces for really stinkin cheap an an event next saturday. So I told her I'd call her back this evening after I thought some more about it. Called and it's a dude's cell, so maybe I wrote down the wrong number. So I emailed her instead. blub blub blub.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I should force myself to do one more email before i fall asleep. Confirming the Maryland bday party like I said I would.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Yeah. There's my day. Running running running.</p>
<p dir=ltr>The party tomorrow is 4 hours long, doing henna. Yeesh my hand is going to hurt after that one. Lol<br><br></p><font color=#550055>

Pretty much the same symptoms I am now experiencing, but much, much more intense, to the point that I was walking around terribly delirious all the time, and with intensely burning eyeballs and sinus passages. Also, waking up all throughout the night drenched in cold sweat. Holy crap that was miserable. I was inside, and it was warm out, and it was still miserable!</p>
<p>I so hope my sickness goes away, holy shit. Last time, I failed to acquire antibiotics until some two weeks after even going to the hospital to begin with, when I was fortunate enough to trade my cigarettes to some dude for his own personal stash of pills. Just dying the whole fucking time, meanwhile. I am lucky I even found them. I'm about to just start going to the ER now, and do it, like, three times a day, just so they will give me antibiotics in whatever regular intervals I walk in at, to be safe. I seriously might do this. I mean, I don't care if they bill me. It might as well be free. They won't refuse me service.</p>
<p>this weirdo who threw money in my face the other night and tried to buy my phone just walked up on me as I was typing, under the impression I had agreed to sell him my phone, and got annoyed with me as though I had jerked him around when I informed him I wasn't selling him the phone. I couldn't even manage to get irritated when it happened. I was just like: dude, what?</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm bitching. Not like I'm doing anything that horrible, but I would rather be paying you more attention, and the only reason I'm really here talking all this shit instead is because it's on my mind already. I don't know. I kinda feel like a zombie too. Meh.</p>
<p>I absorbed your email. I'm happy for your good fortune and jealous of your food. I can kinda smell what I am interpreting as anxious energy, as though you are still shaking off a very engaging day. I can't blame you. I would go pretty crazy working all those things out all the time.</p>
<p>I keep hitting the wrong keys on my screen. Fuck. I am clumsy right now. And I don't have a movie theater screen in my pocket like you do.</p>
<p>I am going to go smoke my last cigarette and prepare to head to my bed. I anticipate still being around for approximately one more email or so. I am scheduling.</p>
<p>hug, hug, hug.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sat, Sep 27, 2014 at 10:06 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:16px"><div><span>I have so many bug bites from yesterday.

<p>so, I didn't feel too shabby when I woke up today. Many symptoms of my sickness remain, but they are generally milder and much easier to ignore, so that's nice. Hopefully this pattern will continue. I intend to take it easy throughout the day today and relax, walking as little as possible, maybe napping some, and hopefully chilling the fuck out on the cigarettes -- which I am thinking should proceed naturally from the decreased walking and the lengthier nap time. But I suppose we will see.</p>
<p>I've had a reduced appetite for the past couple of days that I know is sickness related. It's kinda shitty, because I'm sure my body could probably use the extra nourishment in its process of trying to heal itself, but oh well. I stockpiled a gratuitous amount of some scrambled egg looking concoction at my breakfast today. I was really excited to claim it, because I know I want food, but my appetite had very little interest in it once I actually had it sitting in front of me, so I just took it with me and left. Now I'm sitting here in my makeshift cardboard bed with a heaping plate of the stuff, wondering whether I am going to eat it or maybe just nap. I am still undecided.</p>
<p>I was thinking, as I scampered off with this plate, that I was probably better off leaving and eating it in private, too -- I want to load it up with my hot sauce, you see, in hopes that it will have a productive effect on my sinuses, but I don't quite want to perform this experiment the moment I wake up, surrounded by homeless people eating their own breakfasts, and in the middle of a freakin' church. I mean, I might spontaneously combust. The staff might try to exorcise me or something. I could cause a panic. All in all, not fuckin' cool. Back to my bed I go.</p>
<p>anyway. My phone is dying, and all this crazy talk is making me hungry. I don't know how engaged you will be today, but I'm sure I will be around to check my emails periodically. I hope your crazy four hours of henna tattooing goes okay. I hope your day is excellent. See you around.</p>
<p>p.s., hey, look. A picture.</p>

<p dir=ltr>I will be switching rooms in the next week. More to do! Yay!</p>
<p dir=ltr>My pregnant cousin officially moved out. I haven't seen her in weeks already though. The day she came to take all her stuff was thursday, and I wasn't home. :-( I miss her. I bought her favorite kind of shampoo to use. Just so I could be reminded of her. I guess that's pretty weird. </p>
<p dir=ltr>But anyways. Her room is cleared. Just so happens the heat blows better in that room. And it's maybe like... 6 inches wider than my room. And I need a fresh start, I'll admit. While I'm moving things over, I will also be cleaning. That's the plan anyways.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Time to get up and have breakfast. And prepare myself for 4 hours of henna. And possibly move something over. Like my bed, for starters.</p><font color=#550055>

Ever since meeting you the other day, my battery has been perpetually low or empty for some reason. It is getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>I can't tell if it's being drained extraordinarily fast, or if my perception of how long my charge should last is just inaccurate, or what, really, but, at the same time, I'm finding that the typical charging of my phone I would routinely do has also become anomalous and more complicated, on top of that. The outlets I traditionally use, for instance, are suddenly occupied all the time. And I keep leaving my phone plugged in only to discover it hasn't been charging while it's been plugged in, which never, ever used to happen. I don't even understand! But it is rather bothersome.</p>
<p>I still have yet to nap. I ate half my plate, earlier, then strolled over to a nearby outlet to charge my phone. I sat there and read my Bible for about an hour. I saw the phone start charging when I plugged it in, and I saw that it was still charging when I looked at it an hour later. I checked the battery: fucking 10%. I don't get it! It's already about to die as I type this. Oh well.</p>
<p>I left the other half of my breakfast plate by my bed. Nobody really goes up there, generally speaking. I'm hoping it's still there so I can eat it for lunch. Then, I will nap. Either way, I will nap.</p>
<p>bleh. My mood is bleh. My energy is low. I need my battery charged just like my phone. But I will recover.</p>
<p>see you.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Sep 28, 2014 at 7:01 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:16px"><div><span>I'm sorry you keep having trouble charging your phone.

<p>I woke up from my nap this afternoon after sleeping for a couple of hours and headed to McDonald's, thinking I would have a coffee or two and relax in the air conditioning until my dinner, since it already wasn't too far off. I got there and was horrified to discover: they aren't doing their free coffees any more! Or so a clerk told me, at least. All the promotional signs said the shit ran until the 29th, and I even got a free coffee or two, myself, earlier today, but who am I to argue with the employee? I tried anyway, and I failed. So I ended up just taking off and not relaxing in the air conditioning after all. Boo.</p>
<p>my sickness is still bothering me. I think it actually got worse after I napped. It could be a lot worse, but I still have a constant and disorienting pressure in my head, and it still hurts if I hear much noise. I did a little more walking today than I would have liked, and I smoked more cigarettes today than I would have liked, too. I suck. Maybe tomorrow will be better.</p>
<p>I want to see you again. It's not even like I need to do it, or that I'm trying to do it because I need to do it, but I want to do it, and I think it would be good to do it, expressly for the purpose of yanking your whole body into the pool. You are so very controlled, do you know that? I am wary that you will willfully adopt new reasons to be apprehensive. I feel like I can already smell it. It's not that I want to take away your freedom to be comfortable and take your time -- I don't. I just think it is better if you are in the pool. So, as a doctor, I want to prescribe that you see me.</p>
<p>at the same time, separately from my philosophical position, I am bugged out on a personal level. I don't even know why or whether it is sensible. I think it's just because I care a lot. And that whole, I dunno, many things on the table bullshit. I just feel a distance, really. I feel its energy messing with me. I am trying to just write it off and trust the wind. I know that is probably what I should do. But it's troublesome for me.</p>
<p>I mean, fuck. I'm sorry. Listen. You can hold your cards if you want. I don't want to obligate you or demand that you share your cards, and I tell you this on purpose. You can take your time, resolve such and such in your mind, whatever. And in the event of this or that, I will deal. I will. But I'm telling you the truth: it's not good if you hold them. If you remain apprehensive, it's probably even a direct result of any instances in which you've already held them. Make no mistake: I'm trying to talk the butterfly out, dude. It's not an evil thing I am doing -- I just want her. I want her a lot. Please hear me. That's all.</p>
<p>I don't fucking know. I told myself all day that my next email wouldn't sound like this. Actually, I think I was more worried it would sound worse, and I think this one sounds reasonably balanced in comparison, but it's hard to even gauge, because, frankly, I am quite worried I will trip your sensors and push your buttons, and it's messing with me, and I am crazy. But maybe I want to push your buttons. All of them. All possible arrangements of them! Like a crazy person! Fucking hell, I am a mess. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>honestly, after receiving your next email about your singing, your four hours, and your poor hand, I don't even know if I feel like this any more. I am so wacked out. I am so freakin' wacked out. It's not even like I need you to do some shit, either, I swear. I mean, for ages now, I have waited and survived! I'm fine! It's just that fucking energy, dude. I care a lot! Holy shit I care a lot. I am bouncing off the walls!</p>
<p>I'm leaving all of this here for posterity, and because, what the hell am I gonna do, delete it? Save it for later? Psh. I'm leaving it here so you have my cards. But I don't even know what the fuck it means, really. I'm confused. Let me try and clear it up before I ruin somebody's evening with my nonsense.</p>
<p>I don't intend to force a meeting, and I really don't even care whether that meeting occurs in a hurry -- though I would certainly enjoy your company, in any case. I will not demand you show your cards, or that you work your own business out for my sake, and I won't even make a fuss if you take your time doing it, either, if that's how it goes down. All of that is totally fine. But, but, but: do not feed the sources of your apprehension. Please. It's bad. It's not fine. And if a meeting helps to circumvent your doing this, then it's good.</p>
<p>okay, shit. I'm done. That wasn't too sloppy after all, but I still don't know what the fuck this email is about. Take those cards of mine and burn them! I feel so freakin' weird, yo. Don't hurt me.</p>
<p>okay, I'm holding my breath and sending this without even reading it, FML. Feel free to respond in a completely alternate tone so as not to have your evening totally commandeered. I suck. Give me a break.</p>

<p>yeah okay. Cool. I like that better than no email. Thanks.</p>
<p>I'm not a worrier. I'm chill as fuck. My sudden weirdness is really quite unusual to me. It will probably just take care of itself. But one thing I know will completely neutralize it is if I am reasonably confident that you will keep me in the loop -- particularly, before my own evaluations tell me some totally wild shit and I just get lost, which can happen. All I really require to maintain that confidence, honestly, is to just put some shit on the table for you, because I know that you are awesome toward me, and that your awesomeness is reliable. So I guess that's just what I did. Thanks. I tried to keep it as uninsistent as possible.</p>
<p>you are awesome for real. I appreciate it a lot. Groom, groom, groom. I will never stop. Never, ever, ever.</p>
