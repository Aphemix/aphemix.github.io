 saw your vacation pictures. You did tell me about the cruise, but I 
don't remember how final your plans were when you last brought it up, 
and I don't remember knowing you would be gone for Christmas. I tend to 
forget peripheral things like that. Oops. But I did see the pictures. 
Just yesterday or something, I saw them.<br><br>I moved into my place 
around the beginning of this month. It's a former bed and breakfast 
house I share with 7 other people. It's a nice house; it's pretty chill.
 I live in a little studio apartment with a bathroom. I have a laptop 
I'm bumming off my brother that I watch media on, and I get internet on 
it, sometimes, if I sit on my front porch and the wifi signal behaves. I
 hike into the city most days just to find some shit to do with myself. 
It's like a 40-minute walk away. I eat free meals sometimes, and I talk 
to homeless people n' shit. Then I come back and I sleep inside. It's 
pretty sweet. I can't complain.<br><br>I didn't tell my brother to send 
you a friend request. He sends friend requests to chicks at random, you 
see.&nbsp;I noticed a while back that he and your sister were already 
friends, and I know they don't know each other, so yeah. I'm hoping he 
just saw your picture and decided to send you&nbsp;one out of nowhere 
rather than plotting to send you one on purpose after seeing how many 
freakin' times I must've loaded your page in my browser history, gosh. 
He knows I would flip shit if I caught him doing that, but I'm going to 
have to talk to him today and ask him anyway, because it's possible. I 
dunno. I don't even want to tell him who you are, honestly. That shit 
annoys me and I don't like him in my business. But we'll see what 
happens.<br><br>I made a Craigslist post at one point in hopes that 
someone would donate me a spare wifi antenna, so I could use it to 
connect to the internet without sitting outside just to do it. (My 
fingers are so fucking cold right now, holy shit.) So I get a reply to 
this post, and, coincidentally, it happens to be some dude who gave me a
 laptop for free, like, two years ago, when I posted on Craigslist and 
asked for one. He's not even convinced a wifi antenna will help me pick 
up internet from my house, but he offers to just order me one for 
nothing, so I can check. He also tells me he can give me another laptop 
for free, when I didn't even mention one. So I'm just like.... okay. 
Free laptop! What the hell. The wifi antenna already came in the mail, 
but I got it sent to my brother's address. I'm meeting him today so I 
can retrieve it, and that's when I'll have to bring up the friend 
request thing.<br><br>I need to, like, go inside, and make a coffee, and
 squeeze it really tightly in my hands. Right now. But I'm happy to hear
 from you! Hi! Hi hi hi! And shit.<br><br>:)<br><br>take it easy.<br>&nbsp;<br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Thu, Jan 1, 2015 at 12:55 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr>hi.<br><br>did
 you do anything interesting last night? I didn't. Actually, I hiked for
 like three and a half hours in the cold and spent the night in my 
brother's room by myself while I knew he would be out, and seriously, I 
don't even know why I did it or anything, because I literally have no 
fucking business here at all. But oh well. At least my torrents download
 quickly over here. And I'm hanging out with his dog who loves me.<br><br>I
 got that wireless adapter I mentioned. It's a little USB thing with an 
antenna. Pretty neat. Completely useless for its intended purpose, 
though, as far as I can tell: I still can't get a wifi signal from my 
room. Not reliably, anyway. I may yet resort to connecting the device 
via an extension cord, throwing it a distance out my window, and 
connecting to the internet that way. It would probably work, in real 
life, if I could find a decent cord. Until then, though: oh well. 
There's always the porch and maybe the living room.<br><br>oh, hey. I 
think I might be kinda dating someone. It's weird, though. Do you 
remember this chick I mentioned living next door to my friend Brandie, 
who started hanging on my shit like crazy after I saw her around and 
talked flirtatiously with her really briefly? Well, yeah. I dunno. Tammy
 is her name. She's my age. She has some variety of weird mental issue 
and can barely even hold a conversation, and I'm totally not interested 
in her at all, but she really digs me, apparently. I think I might be 
dating her, but I don't know, because I'm barely participating and I 
sure don't want to bring it up and ask. I mean, fuck. I'm not really 
dating her. But if I asked, she might say I was, and I don't ask, so 
maybe I consent.<br><br>she's bugged me like crazy since I first met 
her. For the first month you went without texting me or so, she would 
message me, usually multiple times per day, about nothing. Most times 
she would just say hi, and I would privately seethe with more and more 
irritation because my phone kept blowing up for no reason and it wasn't 
you texting me. A few times, she would even go on for a while, trying to
 invite me to do some shit with her, expounding on all these details as 
though our life together had already been totally worked out in her 
mind. I did not respond to her even once during this entire period.<br><br>so okay. Cut to, like, a few weeks ago, and she texts me again. Saying hi. For the briefest instant I guess I was just&nbsp;<i>so frustrated&nbsp;</i>that
 my sound mind lapsed and I considered banging her as punishment for 
bothering me. So I answered her text and I immediately steered our 
conversation in the direction of setting up our meeting, asking her 
curtly what we should do when we hang out and overtly prodding her for 
even the most negligible of possible affirmative signals. She responds 
back, though, completely obliviously, asking if we could go out for ice 
cream, and I'm just like:&nbsp;<i>what the fuck is&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;with me. I am talking to a child and an invalid, and I am a terrible person.</i>&nbsp;So
 I agreed to take her out for ice cream because I couldn't even bring 
myself to do anything else but agree. All of this took place in 
approximately two minutes.<br><br>since then, I've met up with her a few
 more times. She keeps asking me to do things like: roll her packs of 
cigarettes and walk absurd distances to deliver them to her, usually 
immediately, or within similar timespans that are equally impossible. 
She clearly has no understanding whatsoever of the lengths I would have 
to go to in order to oblige her requests, or even of the social 
inappropriateness of asking such things of me out of nowhere. I feel for
 her, though. I want to do nice things for her, and something about 
enduring such ridiculous obligations completely thanklessly and without 
acknowledgment really hits the spot for me, and so I keep doing what she
 asks, and I keep meeting her. She might think we're dating. But I 
dunno. She doesn't text me all day any more, on the other hand. Nyeh.<br><br>I
 snatched what must've been a fucking 10lb block of meat from my house's
 freezer before I walked up here, because it was the only thing 
available for me to grab and I didn't want to risk being stuck here 
without food when I got here. Some beef something or other, I don't 
know. Meat. The shit was already pretty old before I took it, but I 
figured it was frozen and I'd just feel it out when I went to cook it. 
Who cares. As it turns out, I have no sense of smell and my brother's 
dog didn't offer me any helpful data at all when I waved it in front of 
her face, so I cut myself like a pound and a half steak off the fucker 
just a bit ago and probably ate the whole freakin' thing without even 
cooking it correctly to begin with. Now I am the experiment. I'm not 
even going to know what the results mean when I see them. My insides are
 probably already destroyed just from attempting to process the size of 
my portion. But I think the point I was making is that if you find I am 
unavailable for any extended period in the near future, I'm probably 
just hanging out on the toilet, or maybe in jail, if I couldn't make it 
to the toilet, and I'm fine. I dunno. I'm just kidding. Maybe.<br><br>okay, time to sit here and psych myself out. Hope you are well. See you.<br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Thu, Jan 1, 2015 at 5:22 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:16px"><div dir=ltr><span>You'd

 hope the meat you ate didn't get you as sick as I have been. I wouldn't
 wish that on anyone! Dad and his girlfriend canceled their New Years 
plans to watch me last night, while discussing off and on whether or not
 to run me to the ER. I can't tell which things were caused by the 
original sickness I was dealing with, or my reaction to amoxicillin. Or 
you know, if I had ebola or something. I called the Urgent Care place 
that gave me the amoxicillin and explained that I had nonstop vomiting 
and diarrhea, and they told me to stay on it, and prescribed me pills to
 help with the nausea.</span></div><div dir=ltr><span><br></span></div><div dir=ltr><span>Yesterday
 morning, as soon as I woke up, I thought there was no way I could make 
it to work. My body hurt all over and I kept going from ice cold to 
burning up. I had a sharp pain in my chest if I breathed normally, so I 
was doing some seriously shallow breathing. Lots of coughing and 
choking. But I didn't have it in me to call off work, because it was new
 years eve, and I didn't want to be that person that woke my boss up 
with a phone call to call off last second on new years eve. They'd 
probably think I was faking. So I loaded up on meds, and dad made me 
breakfast, and I ran out the door. I was training the new girl at work, 
and it was SO miserable. I told the manager as soon as I got there that I
 might need to leave early because I was deathly sick. I made it to 
lunch time, warmed up the soup I brought, and realized I couldn't eat 
it. So I tried to keep working, and a big migraine hit me, and I told my
 trainee I was going to clock out and just sit to the side while she was
 working. And then I started crying from the migraine and was too dizzy 
to drive. So I left with them all worrying, and I sat out in my car 
crying until the cold air made my head clear enough to drive, and then I
 drove home, and immediately had to urge to run to the bathroom. Puke 
and diarrhea at the same time. Like a champ. All of my breakfast. And 
then I went to bed. And then I woke up to run to the bathroom to do it 
some more. and then I went to bed. And so on and so on. And more 
migraines, and more crying, and calling doctor's offices and work to 
call off for today while I was crying and holding a puke bucket up to my
 face. Dad ran for the nausea pills just in time before the pharmacy 
closed early for the holiday. And after I took one of those, I stopped 
throwing up. And at 9 at night, I figured it was time to brave eating 
again, to go along with my next round of amoxicillin. I asked dad's 
girlfriend to get me a strawberry banana smoothie from mcdonalds, and 
she did. That was the only thing I could think of that I could handle. 
and after that, I tackled half of a blueberry bagel. And this morning I 
had a whole blueberry bagel. It is soon time for me to have some more 
blueberry bagel.</span></div><div dir=ltr><span><br></span></div><div dir=ltr><span>I

 sorry I didn't realize you were so sick. The possibility actually 
occurred to me earlier today before I had seen your email and I felt 
insensitive. I'm sorry I didn't get to your emails, too. I had my 
brother and my two friends return this afternoon from the same New 
Year's Eve party we all attended together last year, and we all talked 
and hung out for a while. I saw your email and I even <i>skimmed it, </i>but
 I didn't realize you were such a mess until my friends left and I sat 
down to read over it for real. I mean, I dunno. I would've said 
something. <i>I can't believe all that shit happened to you!</i> I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry all that shit happened to you.<br><br>I'm
 glad you have a positive outlook. I'm glad you are thankful. Side note 
though, imagine she requested you change the date, and you just wouldn't
 do it. That actually would have been pretty fucking horrible if you 
decided you didn't want to bother,&nbsp;refused to reschedule&nbsp;the 
appointment on the basis of your own convenience, and then, even 
retaining the original date of the appointment, just got stuck calling 
off sick in the woman's face. That would be some sick karma, wouldn't 
it? Assuming your client even kept the appointment in the first place! 
Ha! Be thankful, silly. God is with you. You dodge bullets all the time.<br><br>the
 truth is, dear, we don't know at all how appropriate it is to be 
thankful or to be miserable, no matter the circumstance. We might 
understand that our troubles are blessings in some cases, but what about
 all the complex causal relationships between events we do not 
understand? How many instances of tangible benefit are we 
misinterpreting as <i>harm </i>and <i>loss </i>when our shortsighted 
measurements of our own experiences show contradictory evidence that our
 troubles are indeed very real? It is impossible to even calculate the 
answer.<br><br>I will tell you the truth. The truth is that you are 
under God's protection all the time, and he is looking out for you 
diligently all the time, so that all things work together to engineer 
your blessings all the time. This is true, I swear it. Your measurements
 of your own experiences will never tell you this, and you will never 
learn it by those measurements, but your understanding of God's 
character and God's mind will make it <i>very </i>apparent what God will
 do. Then you will recognize his blessings with a progressively greater 
degree of accuracy, and you will be<i>&nbsp;</i>thankful in all ways, 
and the threat of loss will no longer hurt you. You will be a different 
creature, and by these differences you will do much and accomplish many 
things. This is why the Lord instructs as he does, when he does. That is
 the reason. The reason is so that you will receive all the blessings. 
And it works. It's <i>crazy.&nbsp;</i><br><br>I've missed you. I am happy to talk to you. You are awesome.<br><br>good night.</div>

What that means is basically just that it's a <i>standardized format </i>by
 which data is presented to your computer. That is, it's a particular 
configuration in which that data is arranged which allows your computer 
to interact with that data as long as it is equipped to navigate that 
arrangement.<br><br>HTTP, for example, is another data transfer 
protocol. It's a standardized format. Because web page data is arranged 
according to the HTTP format, your browser is able to act according to a
 set of rules and process that web page data correctly, which is why you
 are able to view web pages. Now,&nbsp;HTTP is a protocol that exists 
for the specific purpose of enabling a web site to be displayed, so, for
 that reason, only such things as text and hyperlinks are presented to 
your computer in the HTTP format. Bittorrent is a different kind of 
protocol. It exists for the purpose of enabling the transfer of files 
between many different computers which each contain different elements 
of the files. So, instead of text and hyperlinks being presented to your
 computer, as is the case with HTTP data, your computer, when receiving 
Bittorrent data, is presented with such things as tiny chunks of files, 
the locations of those files on other computers, and the addresses of 
those other computers, in order that this transfer of many different 
elements, as intended, may be facilitated between many different 
computers.<br><br>HTTP is an efficient means of transferring website 
data from a web server to your computer. Bittorrent, on the other hand, 
is an efficient means of transferring files between many users, on many 
computers -- particularly, in the case that many users are attempting to
 interact with the files at one time, and, particularly, when it is 
advantageous that those files <i>not </i>remain in one single location, 
like on the web server of a single website. What this means is that the 
Bittorrent protocol is most often used in cases of illegal file 
transfers, like the downloading of copywritten content. This is because 
conducting the transfer of those files between many computers helps to 
ensure that the files are transferred efficiently -- even in the case 
that one of those computers is targeted, as in the case of legal action 
being taken against its owner.&nbsp;In other words, because many 
computers are participating in the transfer of Bittorrent data, that

 and I just spent the past two hours frustrated as shit trying to pop 
his locked door open after he accidentally locked us out of his room. I 
had left all my things inside, too -- which was pretty much just this 
laptop I'm using and my cigarette rolling machine, but that's my <i>quality of&nbsp;life, </i>dammit.
 But holy crap. I was so frustrated I was ready to just ditch it so I 
didn't have to worry about popping this fucking door lock any more. Just
 wait until Monday when his landlord showed up to open it or whatever, 
and just not have my shit the whole time. I dunno. Frustrated as shit.<br><br>I
 was praying, too. Just praying the door would open, trying to figure 
out how I was supposed to approach it in prayer so that something would 
actually happen. Eventually it occurred to me how fucked Justin would be
 if the door didn't open.&nbsp;I started thinking about paying for a 
locksmith to open his door. I have like 80 dollars in my pocket I'm <i>really trying to not spend, </i>because
 I want to put it toward a used desktop computer for my room. I mean, I 
can't make music on a shitty laptop. I need something decent and I need 
to save money because I'm a broke fucking chump. It pretty much didn't 
even occur to me that I had the option to spend money at all because 
I've been so dead set on putting this money toward my thing. And who the
 fuck has money to drop on a locksmith? But I was about ready to just 
say fuck my thing and pay a locksmith. I asked Justin to triple-check 
his pockets to make sure he didn't have his keys, and after he did, I 
was going to do it. Then, poof. He popped the door open.<br><br>SO craycray.<br><br>bai.<br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>artismyjoy333@yahoo.com </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sat, Jan 3, 2015 at 11:11 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>I'm

 had a nightmare last night, too. My memory of it has mostly vanished, 
but I remember it in bits and pieces: &nbsp;I was with my brother, and 
demons were manifesting to him visibly, and I could see them. He was 
incredibly panicked. I think he was even crying and hyperventilating. I 
was cradling him and speaking very soothingly to him, attempting to 
reassure him and help him, and I was also praying out loud and issuing 
the demons commands, very assertively, meaning to ward the them away, 
but our environment was very hectic, and my attempts were not working, 
and I was quite frantic and alarmed. I don't know exactly what happened 
next, but afterward, I was alone with the demons. I could still see 
them, and the threat of their presence was the same, but I approached 
them differently: I prayed, and I commanded, but I was not at all 
discouraged by my failure, and I was not scared. I simply continued my 
attempts again in a procedural fashion as soon as I had finished, and I 
eventually caused myself to wake up by doing it.<br><br>I woke up last 
night wondering what it meant. I didn't even have an accompanying sense 
that the dream was a spiritual attack against me; I just found it very 
peculiar and noteworthy. I suppose I will pray about it if it even 
continues to occur to me. I might have already forgotten had you not 
mentioned having your own nightmare in your email.<br><br>anything that 
has a significant effect on how your body normally functions will likely
 cause you nightmares, and is probably the prime suspect, but I can't 
really say any more without having more information. I chalked mine up 
to my coffee intake, because I drank more coffee than usual last night 
immediately prior to going to sleep. Maybe yours is also coffee. Maybe 
not.<br><br>I'm just teasing you about your workout videos, silly. I would not fault you for anything.<br><br>cheers.<br><br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>artismyjoy333@yahoo.com </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Jan 4, 2015 at 2:36 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>In

the best way to make sure children don't pop out of me is to not get 
into a relationship in which there is not a 100% chance of me not 
getting pregnant. Because let me tell ya, it is NICE to not have to 
worry about that stuff. at all. Or other relationship poop. So far in

 sure it is no mystery to you how I feel about the things you are saying

 I be allowed to pursue you and succeed, and for as long as I don't, I

 you first shut me down and proceeded to keep your distance, it stressed
 me out a lot. I prayed so much. Every day, all throughout the day, and <i>desperately, </i>I
 prayed. Every time this poor girl sent me a text, I prayed, and every 
time I picked up my phone and saw who it was, my heart sunk and I just 
prayed even more. I was about to move into my place, too, and I fucking <i>begged </i>that
 I could take it back -- that God would return you to me instead, and 
that I could continue living on the street. I was so freakin' upset I 
didn't even care about the house I was moving into. It didn't mean 
anything to me at all and I just dreaded having to deal with it when it 
happened.<br><br></div>even after I got here, I didn't care. I 
considered just ditching the place and returning to homelessness and 
traveling aimlessly. Like rolling the dice again and hoping for a better
 outcome next time. Maybe if I just got my shit fucked up badly enough, 
something productive might happen, I said to myself. Something more 
productive than this freakin' house I didn't even care about. I prayed 
constantly, of course. I prayed that you would return to me, and I 
prayed that my feelings would not be taken away from me, no matter how 
troublesome they were. I prayed that I could accept the position the 
Lord put me in. I prayed that God might just <i>tell me something, </i>so I could start to wrap my head around what I was even supposed to be doing. Everything I could think to pray, I prayed.<br><br></div>one
 Saturday night, after being here for probably less than a week, I had 
one of my housemates invite me to attend a church service with him the 
next morning after learning that I was a Christian. Now, I'm not really 
very big on church, at all, but I immediately agreed. I wanted to accept
 whatever I found placed in front of me, you see, so as not to 
potentially inhibit anything that might be productive. I took it as 
God's invitation, more or less, and I did not want to refuse. I needed 
everything I could possibly get my hands on.<br><br></div>so, Sunday 
morning rolls around, and I wake up, like, a minute before my alarm is 
supposed to go off, which is weird. I immediately feel like I don't want
 to take the trouble to go to this church service and start thinking of 
excuses not to do it. Instantly, though, I hear a knock on my bedroom 
door. I know it's this freakin' <i>dude </i>coming to get me, so I ignore it. I didn't need to be ready for a whole other <i>hour. </i>I mean, <i>fuck </i>that
 guy! He keeps knocking, though. He won't go away. Eventually, I answer.
 He's there all suited up and awake, telling me some shit about how the 
church van is coming early to pick us up, and I need to get ready. <i>Early! </i>Fuckin'
 hell. So I tell him I need to get dressed, and I say I'll be outside in
 a minute. In other words: I needed to roll a cigarette, and I'd be 
outside in a minute to tell him I <i>wasn't going, </i>in my <i>pajamas. </i>I close the door in his face and I plan to let him down as considerately as possible when I talk to him.<br><br>I
 get out there, though, and holy crap. Much to my horror, he's standing 
in the middle of the street, looking expectantly over his shoulder at me
 the second I open the door, and already half a step inside this fucking
 <i>van, </i>which is just hovering there with its engine running, full of people waiting on me, and ready to go. I felt <i>so bad. </i>I
 looked at this guy about as sheepishly as humanly possible, knowing I 
didn't even have time to explain myself or anything, and I just told 
him, look, I'm not going. It's too early. The van took off, and it was 
over.<br><br></div><div>I was sitting there smoking my cigarette, 
ruminating, after that. I really felt bad. I felt like I had turned down
 God's invitation for no reason, and I felt irresponsible, too, for 
telling the guy I would go and changing my mind. I was partially 
praying, and partially just working out my own thoughts in my mind -- I 
often do this. It's kinda just how I think. Suddenly, though, out of 
nowhere, I just got this weird sense that was very much unlike my 
thoughts. I saw, all at once and with stunning clarity, that my 
accepting this invitation and ditching out at the last minute had these 
strong and unmistakable parallels to your deciding to put me on hold. I 
was immediately aware that God had given me exactly the information I 
had asked him for. He said: <i>it's too early. </i>He showed me what the situation meant, and I was amazed. I went back up to my room and I prayed and I bawled.<br><br></div><div>look,
 I'm babbling. I'm very fucking interested, okay? That's all there is to
 it. It stresses me out and I pray about it all the time. But you are 
your own person. You will do what you want, and you don't owe me 
anything, and I will be fine. I don't need God to tell me it is wrong 
for me to push you or compel you in a direction of my choice. And I have
 already long since resolved that I would accept your apprehension and 
allow you your space. A year ago, when I understood you would not meet 
me, I resolved it. You don't need to probe me and feel me out to hear 
these things. You can just ask me and I will tell you.<br><br></div><div>I
 hope your date for funsies goes okay, I guess. Feel free to tell me 
about it. And try not to get caught up like an idiot.

long enough to spit my thoughts right back at me. And I've probably 
voiced them in some way in the year I've been talking to you.</p>
<p dir=ltr>On another note, I did my first working out of the year 
today. 20 minutes! A 10 minute core workout, and a 10 minute dance 
workout. I must do a minimum of 10 minutes a day. Ideally I'll do more 
than that most days. Usually once I get started, I don't want to stop 
after 10 minutes. Starting is the hardest part. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm going to a memorial service for my friend's father 
tomorrow morning. I didn't know him, but I think it'll be good to be 
there just for her. </p><font color=#550055>

 not offended that you would label me a psychopath, because I am one. I 
have intentionally made it clear many times that I am one. I do find it 
frustrating, however, when misconceptions about that label cause me to 
be understood poorly. AKA, every single time I tell anyone. I will 
attempt to clarify. Let's see how this turns out.<br><br></div>psychopathy begins with an <i>inhibited neurological response </i>to <i>fearful stimuli. </i>I
 have that same response. Because fearful stimuli is insufficiently 
discouraging, psychopaths are able to examine themselves, coming to 
develop an extraordinarily acute awareness of their own psychological 
processes. I have that same awareness. As a result of this awareness, 
psychopaths also have a keen insight into the psychological processes of
 others, and I have that insight, too. All of this familiarity with 
psychological processes, then, gives psychopaths a strong upper hand in 
the precise manipulation of those processes, be them their own or those 
of others. I have that upper hand, as well. With that upper hand, of 
course, comes an intrinsic understanding of <i>causation, </i>or the 
relationships between events and their outcomes. Just the same, I have 
that understanding. And that's it. That's a psychopath. That's me.<br><br></div>psychopaths
 tend to be thrill seekers, or troublemakers. This is due to their 
relationship with dopamine, an addictive drug. Because their reduced 
susceptibility to fearful stimuli coupled with the increased 
availability of their desired outcomes tends to acclimate them to a 
higher degree of dopamine output than the average person's, psychopaths 
tend to require abnormally extreme engagements just to trigger the 
dopamine output they are expecting, which leads to the thrill seeking 
behavior. Now, me, while I won't deny I can be a bit of a troublemaker, 
I've also understood my condition for a very long time. I am mature, so,
 in my maturity and my understanding, I have tempered myself, on 
purpose, to great effect. Granted, I do still enjoy my thrills. They're 
pretty neat. I won't lie. I'm sure I even get my jollies from them in a 
way that is abnormal. The distinction is that I am not <i>dependent </i>on
 them, which grants me the luxury of being able to forgo them without 
suffering consequences for myself. I am quite unlike the typical 
psychopath in this way.<br><br></div>psychopaths also tend to have poor 
impulse control, and to be markedly unskilled at delaying their own 
gratification. This is because they are essentially handicapped. That 
is: a regular person has effective fear conditioning and a vast array of
 prohibitive psychological factors dissuading him from indulging his 
impulses, necessitating he compromise to his environment at all times, 
but a psychopath, on the other hand, encounters progressively fewer 
challenges, and even experiences a progressively greater incentive to do
 his will, as he develops cognitively over time and his means proceed to
 increase. The outcome of these extenuating circumstances, then, is that
 psychopaths tend not to attain to proficiency in the same measures of 
self-discipline we take for granted in regular people, which, just as 
you would expect, leaves them with a comparatively poor degree of 
impulse control as a result. Pretty straightforward. This issue, 
however, is far from irreparable, and, indeed, is able to be remedied at
 any time by mere learning and practice. While a shortsighted or an 
insufficiently motivated psychopath may never encounter any reason to 
undertake such tasks, I am not that person. Rather, I have opted to 
discipline myself, and I do it. Again, I am quite atypical in this 
respect.<br><br></div>any psychopath should be able to decide at any 
time to moderate himself. The extent of his psychological malleability 
and prowess enables him a greater ability to do his will than most any 
others have. Yet so few ever actually attain to any significant measure 
of harmlessness, or health, or goodness. Why is this? It's because, 
without some kind of miracle or profoundly transformative agent at work,
 the psychopath's true will is going to be merely to serve himself 
alone, because that's what everyone's will is. That is: without the 
prohibitive psychological factors of a regular person, and without being
 required to compromise to his environment by force, there is no real 
reason for the psychopath to moderate himself, and he will never attain 
to goodness.<br><br></div>this is where I differ most from the typical psychopath: my <i>will </i>is <i>different. </i>There
 are two reasons for this, and I will tell you what they are, because I 
know them. First of all, I experienced love, which changed my whole 
life. It gave me a perspective that I previously could not have 
imagined. It provided me a context within which I was able to determine 
for the first time just who I was, and what I wanted, and what was what,
 and I knew, then, that serving myself was ridiculous, and I knew what 
was good. After that, I eventually discovered Jesus Christ, who, by his 
word and his Spirit, taught me how to attain to goodness, taught me how 
to maintain a pure heart that would not waver or dissipate, and gave me 
the ability to actually do those things. In other words: once I knew 
what was good and I knew how to do it, my will was allowed to change. 
Such things do not happen by accident. They only ever happen by way of 
miracle.<br><br></div>you ask me to solve your riddle. You ask me to 
guess why you won't let me pursue you. I am sure that you are thinking 
of all kinds of things. Your fear. Your past experiences. Your desire to
 keep from being influenced. The presumed effect on your ability to do 
what you want. The presumed complications of explaining yourself to your
 family. I don't know, dude. Really, all of that shit sounds like small 
potatoes and nonsense to me. I don't doubt that all of them could be 
managed, and managed easily. But either way, I don't think you even know
 the answer. I think <i>I </i>know the answer.<br><br></div>just saying, friend.

<p dir=ltr>I haven't showered since friday morning. I guess that's kind of ew. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I met the guy, and he's a cool cat. We've already had very 
open discussion about what he wants and what I want and marked out his 
pursuance of me as anything but a friend. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Friday morning, I went to my friend's father's funeral. I 
got dressed up and made up, and when I went to leave the house, I got a 
wave of social anxiety because I looked too dolled up. I was sitting in 
the driveway in my running car getting really made at myself because I 
would be showing up to catch the second Hal of the viewing before his 
mass started, and I felt like a skank. And I was uncomfortable with 
being around a bunch of people whom I didn't know, mourning for someone 
whom I've met twice. I knew my friend wouldn't be able to pay me much 
attention, but she had hinted she would appreciate me being there for 
her. So... I'm sitting in my car. I got out and came back in, resolved 
that I just wouldn't go. And then father came out of his room and asked 
me if I was alright, and I explained. And he told me I was being silly, 
and it was never too late to go and be there for her. So I changed into a
 dressy black jumpsuit with a long-ass
button up shirt over to. Much less feminine. Or less. Idk. I felt more 
comfortable. And I swiped a bit of the makeup off. And I went very late.
 And surprisingly, there was still a line of people going out into the 
hall, waiting to enter the room where they could wish their condolences 
and be seated for mass. So nobody would ever know I was late. And then I
 said hi to my friend, and I sat there for mass. And then I left, and 
that was that. I did it.</p>
<p dir=ltr>And then I saw my sister. And then I met this dude briefly 
for coffee. And then I wandered the Lititz shops for another 40 minutes.
 And then I went home.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I have to go run an errand with father before work. I'll tell you about the rest of my weekend later.</p>

 just woke up like twenty minutes ago. On my way to grab my laptop from 
my room after making my first coffee of the day in my kitchen, I heard 
these strange and really forceful wheezing noises as I came up the 
steps. It sounded like ghosts howling. It sounded like there were ghosts
 howling loudly in my house. I was actually a bit apprehensive of even 
going any further because of the noise. But I continued to my room, 
seeing nothing, figuring one of my neighbors just had some very weird 
and obnoxious manner of yawning upon first waking up. I laughed it off. 
Out loud, I laughed. Then I grabbed my laptop and headed out the other 
side of the house to smoke my cigarette and check my email, just like I 
do every morning. And on my way out here, I saw one of my housemates 
collapsed in the doorway of his room. He had a seizure, apparently. I 
hear he has them all the time. I did nothing. And now I'm out here 
smoking my cigarette and drinking my coffee. Typing you an email. Good

 after going to the funeral, and seeing my sister, and meeting dude. I 
went home. and then I went to hang with Georgette. We blew a gift card 
of mine to taco bell on zesty burrito-type things. I hadn't eaten since 
breakfast, so I stuffed myself. Fairly daring, since that was my last 
day on amoxicillin. Georgette corrected me and told me it was 
"amoxillin" and that I've been saying it wrong for years. I was driving,
 so I couldn't look it up to disprove her, and she totally had me 
convinced I had been saying it wrong for years. an hour later I looked 
it up, to find that it is indeed amoxicillin, and that she has been the 
one saying it wrong for years. ADORABLE.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Then
 we went back to her place. She bought me wine, so I had sweet wine 
while she drank everclear. One glass of wine is all it takes to make me a
 silly giggle-box. So that's what I had. and we watched the movie Clue. 
and did lots of chatting. and I slept over. and in the morning we had 
breakfast burritos at Sonic on the way to drop her at work. and then I 
went home. and then I met dude again at the Lititz library where a band 
was playing. The room with the band was too full to even enter, so we 
sat at one of the tables in the quiet room, and talked for a wee bit. 
And then I went home and got ready for my birthday gig, went to the 
birthday gig, stopped at Georgette's afterward, since her wallet somehow
 ended up in my bag. Neither of us have any idea how that happened. I'm 
just thankful she wouldn't have thought I would try to steal it.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Sunday
 I deemed to be a stay at home in my pajamas day. I made valentine cards
 with my dad's girlfriend's daughter. I did this with her other daughter
 a few days before. So it was only fair! Then dudie dude asked me if I 
wanted to hang out, and I explained it was pajama day, so the only way 
we were hanging out was if he came to my place. and so he did! and my 
sister called to hang out with me shortly after dude decided he was 
going to come over, and she came over as well. and left just after he 
got here.&nbsp;</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Dude and I 
made hot chocolate from scratch, and added cherry rum. it was quite 
tasty. Then we did crafty jewelry projects for a couple of hours. Then 
he introduced me to swing dancing. We danced a lot. It was fun stuff! 
Then we ran out at 10 at night in our socks and jumped on the 
trampoline. Then sat around a hot air vent in the house pretending it 
was a campfire. and more talking. and eating. and talking. 2 in the 
morning rolled around, and he attempted to leave, but everything outside
 was coated in a sheet of wet ice from the freezing rain. So I made up 
the guest bedroom for him to stay in. In the morning I made us 
breakfast. and then he left. and a half hour later, I left for work. 
After work, I visited my sister.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>And that's my Friday through Monday happenings. :-)</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Oh.
 When I hung out with Georgette, I told her my Armando and Mar story. 
And I told her how I just looked up the girl and found out she's in New 
York going to graduate school. So I don't need to worry about running 
into her any time soon. But that I have no idea where Armando is. 
Georgette looked up Armando. And apparently he lives in Ephrata now. 10 
minutes down the very same road I live on. How quaint.&nbsp;</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>I've
 been very happy lately. Like basket-case happy. Like hardly anything

 has a thing for me. Soon I will need to speak to him on these matters. I
 am not okay with the direction he is trying to take this newly formed 
friendship. We shall have words. And then I will hang out with him once 
in a blue moon probably, and mostly in group settings. </p>
<p dir=ltr>He's a total sweetheart. I really dislike shutting him 
down, only because it makes me feel like a jerk for not being able to 
meet his needs and make him feel better. I think the best thing to do is
 to not put it softly. I need to sever all the strings so that he's not 
hanging onto one for a while, so that he moves faster to find someone 
who can and will meet his needs. That makes sense right? Because it's 
hard to move on when one deceives themself to think there may still be a
 hint of a chance where they are. </p>
<p dir=ltr>We had a nice day yesterday. He invited me to join him for 
dinner some place earlier in the week and I declined. Then he brought it
 up again and said he'd pay since I treated for the coffee at our 
initial meeting. Not that I cared about the money, but I just wasn't 
feeling like it. But I could see he really wanted me to go. So I changed
 my mind and agreed. His house was on the way there, and he offered to 
drive us from his place. I convinced him to let me drive us though. 
After lunch we went and checked out a park along the Susquehanna. And I 
drove him back home.</p>
<p dir=ltr>We were having a party at my place last night. Cooking 
steak and spam and hotdogs and marshmallows out on a campfire. Earlier 
in the day I invited him, but I didn't realize he agreed and said he was
 coming to that. I don't know how I missed that. So he was here again 
last night for that. It was a good time. My friend Larry also came over.
 And a bunch of my dad's work friends. And my uncle. There was 12 of us 
at least... yeah, I think 12.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Anyways. I caught on throughout the day that he is pursuing
 me. And after he left, he sent me some text about how he can't stop 
staring at my lips and admiring them. Sigh. Why, dude, why? </p>
<p dir=ltr>The situation with you is quite different. But difficult to
 explain. You ask why I do not hang out with you like that. Jumping on a
 trampoline and crap. There are reasons. I'm going to try and explain, 
but please know it's probably going to be a butchered and incomplete 
explaination. Okay- one, because I don't want you to win me over. I know
 your motives in hanging out. And I know your talk is smooth as fuck. If
 I gave you my time, you'd most likely eventually win. Two, I don't want
 to be won over by someone so smart and good with words and reading me 
correctly, who also doesn't take on responsibilities that I think are 
important. Actions speak louder than words. I will not become a slave to
 a man's words again. Because that't the shit Armando pulled, in a more 
inferior way to how you would pull it, I'm sure. Locked me in with 
pretty words and his knowledge of the way I think, and then used me for 
sex and money, and caused me great
emotional turmoil and didn't give any fucks. Bam. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Dude, if you had the lifestyle that lined up with mine, 
being responsible and self sustaining with a career and such, it would 
be a done deal. But that's not you, and that's not what you want. And I 
get that. And I still love you and all for who you are and how you are. 
I'm just not about to align myself with such a fate to allow myself to 
be vulnerable like that again to someone I feel I shouldn't make myself 
vulnerable to. That would not lead to a stable, mutually beneficial 
relationship. And whatever you say in response to that, that's just it. 
It's words. It's not actions. I take them with a grain of salt. I love 
you man. I do. But no no no no, no can of worms for me please. No thank 
you. No thanks. No. </p>
<p dir=ltr>You know what I really love? That I am SO happy by myself 
right now. Holy shit. It's the best! Well it's not the best in some 
aspects. But in most aspects. Like. Damn! I am so happy. It's like I'm 
disconnected with reality. I cannot stop smiling. And laughing. I am a 
rainbow explosion waiting to happen. I might as well start weaving 
baskets. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I started doing paper mache projects this past week. They 
are so fun! I made a little top hat. And I'm working on making a little 
turtle that runs. It has a pull string, and works similar to a yoyo. Oh,
 and making valentine cards that open up to make 3d flowers. And I'm 
making paper beads, and maki making earrings out of said paper beads. 
But today. Today I'm going to clean and do accounting. So I hope! I 
really really hope! First I'm going to have coffee. And cut up steak 
chunks, and cook them, and eggs, and onions, and have a steak eggs and 
onion and cheese burrito for breakfast with lots of hot sauce. Mmmm. My 
mouth is watering already. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Sending you love, friend. </p><font color=#550055>

<p dir=ltr>I'm enjoying a glass of wine from the bottle that was 
sealed too tightly for me to open for a while. I got father to open it 
for me before he ran to work today. Mmmmm fruity.</p>
<p dir=ltr>The costume prancing was brought on by me starting to 
clean. Costumes were out and needed put away. And I got distracted very 
quickly.</p>
<p dir=ltr>My father told me that my mother confided in him and told 
him that she gave her "fiance" until the end of February to get out of 
her house. I am not to tell her that dad told me. I have to wait until 
she tells me. I'm glad he gave me a heads up though. I know there is a 
chance that since this guy is such smooth talker that he won't be 
leaving. It's a long time until the end of february for him to make her 
change her mind. I am wishing her the strength to get through it. My 
heart is aching very much for her. She is very insecure. And she is very
 warn down by him already. She's taken a step, and I hope she gets 
through the storm.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I feel like I'm more observant of my life right now than 
submersed in the feelings of it. Much like a dream. I could particularly
 feel this way because I am tipsy off of half a glass of wine. I'm 
sitting here and decided I'd pinch my wrist as hard as I could, because 
as a wimpy girl, that should hurt enough that I wouldn't do it to 
myself. But I did a few times with no problem. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I wish I could read the next chapter of my book and see 
what I make of my life. I'm curious to know where I'm going. And I want 
to read on so I can know how soon until my mom is okay. It makes me want
 things to move faster, even though time is already moving too fast for 
me to keep up. I'm being such a dreamer thinking of all the 
possibilities.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I had a nice time with you yesterday. And I had a nice time
 talking to you on the phone. You strange, beloved person. You're good 
company. </p>
<p dir=ltr>The day is gone. And I put away a little laundry, but now 
there is another load to put away. And my room is still trashed. Cycle 
repeat! I think I should donate a bunch of things soon.</p>
<p dir=ltr>For my birthday I want to have a cards against humanity pajama party. I think that would be nice. :-)</p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm very very very sleepy. Sleep for me momentarily.<br><br><br><br></p><font color=#550055>

 help me get my silly head in order while I proceed to dilly dally like a

 dear oh dear, I'm in touchy face painting territory. I hope I didn't 
just open up a can of worms by sharing information. I got contacted by a
 community center in York, asking for a face painting quote for a 2-hour
 festival with 100+ kids. I sent them a quote for 2 artists, stating I 
would find a second artist to accommodate the large crowds if they chose
 to book. I reached out to a York face painter and asked her 
availability for that date and time, and she texted me back saying she's
 already booked at that time for the community center's event that she's
 been doing the past 4 years. Same event! So. I don't know the details. 
I'm hoping I didn't just catch them trying to fuck her over. I texted 
back telling her it's the same event that I'm being contacted for, and 
asked how many painters they usually have each year. I hope I didn't 
just start some shit. I really really hope. She hasn't texted me back 
yet. Hopefully hell isn't about to break open. If anything, I'm 
aggravated with the event planner for withholding information from both 
myself and the painter who has been painting at this event every year.

 My inbox took like a half hour just to tell me you emailed me, for some
 reason. I've been sitting out here in the cold the whole time talking 
to my brother on Facebook. I could've responded to you a dozen times by 
now. You and your wacky pajama party propaganda.<br><br>he's telling me a
 story of some chick I'm sure he met on Tinder or Craigslist or 
something who he apparently invited to spend the weekend at his place on
 two separate occasions recently -- he says he feels like he had a 
hooker over. He says she peed in his mouth a couple of times, which he's
 mentioned before has been some weird fantasy of his. He says she comes 
over with drugs he likes, and they do them. He says she prays to Satan 
and cites numerous examples of how Satan has helped her in her life. He 
cries to me that he thinks the devil is offering her to him on a silver 
platter for the purpose of messing with him. What do I even say? I told 
him to stop dealing in hooker's wages if he has a problem with hookers. I
 tell him "resist the devil, and he will flee from you." I tell him the

 I was prompted to start looking through my memorabilia after being 
invited on Facebook to take part in a "challenge" in which I share my 
art each day for 5 days. I thought it would be cute to share art from 
when I was really little. So I found a bunch of that and I also found a 
bunch of other stuff that is bringing back lots of memories and 
emotions. I save a lot of shit. I saved a note that my boyfriend left me
 in my locker at high school to let me know he left early that day 
because he was sick. I saved a letter from my mother that I received 
from her right before I sent her my letter telling her that I couldn't 
talk to her for a while. That one is a tear jerker. I saved 
parent-teacher conference feedback papers. A bunch of notes and cards 
from friends. A crap ton of pictures. I even saved the shed skin of one 
of my ball pythons. Creepy, huh? Lots of good stuff. I'm
really enjoying going through it. </p><font color=#550055>

<p dir=ltr>"When it is summer, I like to go to the wooden playground. I

 me because I'm really strong. Oh my gosh, those boys are sissies. He he
 sorry boys."</p>
<p dir=ltr>"My favorite pony is up to the sky. Up to the Sun. I like 
to watch Cowboys ride horses. Wouldn't it be fun to have my pony on top 
of spaghetti. I see bunnies that love each other."</p>
<p dir=ltr>"I would not like a regular horse. I would like a pony. If I had my own horse, I would take him wherever I go."</p>
<p dir=ltr>"After school I almost all the time go on a hike. And I 
like to go to the wooden playground because there is a swing there that I
 can swing on. It goes around and around. And there is even a thing that
 is supposed to be a horse. And they made it out of tires. And sometimes
 when I'm really lucky I get dad into playing battleship. Or I am able 
to race somebody in my family that would race me and I mostly have dad 
race me and my sister Elizabeth would race me too. I'd mostly win. I win
 almost all the time. And I ride my bike. And I play with Carlos at 
home. And I can play Candyland inside with my sister."</p>

 day today. Woke up feeling distant from God and insecure about the good
 he's doing for me. Dicked around on my cigarette thing a hundred times,
 which, of course, is the reason I felt that way to begin with, and only
 makes it worse. Been trying to just prod myself to be thankful that my 
shit behavior acts as useful encouragement rather than being wasted to 
no effect. It's a weird thing, to feel good about feeling bad. To 
distinctly feel good and bad separately about the same things. I'm fine.
 I'm always fine, y'know. It's just weird.<br><br></div>it's fascinating
 to me how this distance from God thing works. Like, I'll pray, for 
example, but I'll feel disingenuous about it. After all: how can I be 
sincere about wanting to bridge the distance when my behavior is 
contradictory and I am responsible? So I pray, but my sincerity doesn't 
have the same <i>reach; </i>it isn't able to cover as broad a territory 
without encountering contradictions and invalidating itself. As a 
result, I feel like fewer things are addressed. And when fewer things 
are addressed, fewer data points exist, and my <i>means </i>of <i>conceiving God's action </i>are
 also fewer. Because of this, I am left with fewer avenues by which I 
might be persuaded -- to the effect that God's presence is <i>less believable, </i>and, therefore, less perceptible. It's a fucking real thing! I know how it works and everything!<br><br>I
 don't know. I'm weird. I hope your day has been good. My next few might
 be a little shaky, but I'm cool. I kinda miss ya. My cigarette thing is
 pretty dumb; it makes me want to be sad about some shit for no reason. 
It has the propensity to make me a poor conversation partner, and I'm 
kinda feeling more like formulating my thoughts indoors than like 
sitting outside and seeing if you're around anyway, so I've opted for 
the classic email approach tonight, because I'm cool like that. Besides:
 I don't need to do any upkeep anyway. Right? Right.<br><br>if you can 
bear with me when I am weak, I promise you can deal with all of my shit.
 It's not that much shit. And I'm only weak in short and low intensity 
bursts anyway. I'm getting pretty good at it.<br><br>slap slap slap. My dear, my dear, my dear. Good night.<br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Mon, Feb 9, 2015 at 8:55 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "artismyjoy333@yahoo.com" &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr><div><div><div><div><div><div>aight, checkem.<br><br></div>so,
 six years ago or whatever, y'know, I had this thing happen to me. This 
serious thing I've told you about. And, I mean, this thing was very 
serious. The seriousness of this thing cannot be overstated. Let me just
 paint you a picture real fast.<br><br></div>I will tell you how serious
 it was. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was literally so serious 
that, by this thing -- by the perspective I was revealed; by the ability
 I was granted; by the position I subsequently found myself in -- I was 
provided the opportunity to more or less place the entire world in 
subjection to myself. And I'll tell you what, too: as time has passed, 
the relevant dominoes have only moved to more convenient locations than 
before, my understanding of their behavior has only grown superior to 
what it was, and that opportunity only continues to hang closer to my 
face. That's the kind of shit we're talking about. Serious. Real.<br><br></div>now,
 we talk about things like getting tattoos, or shaving your head, and 
the effect those minute changes might have on how a person acts or how 
he sees himself. We talk about people like your mom, who might rush 
unwisely into this or that relationship on the basis of her being weak 
and seeking the path of least resistance. I want you to think about 
those subjects in the context of my thing and its seriousness, and I 
want you to appreciate the enormity of the incentive I have -- that is, 
my incentive to go ahead and follow up on my thing; the immense weight 
of that incentive. It's pretty immense.<br><br></div>now, because of that immense weight and the danger it poses, to <i>save </i>myself, it has been <i>absolutely necessary </i>for me to totally reject the will to pursue my own aspirations, and to instead push myself, <i>forcefully, </i>in the completely <i>opposite </i>direction:
 that is, to utterly dissociate from the desire to live according to my 
own preferences. So that's exactly what I did. A very difficult thing, I
 did.<br><br></div>my point is this. These faculties I have had to 
remove from myself -- in addition to making me vulnerable to being 
seduced by Satanic power, and therefore being <i>very dangerous </i>-- 
they happen to also be the biggest reasons a normal person will work and
 pursue a career. A normal person has these faculties, and, by them, he 
is prompted to pursue such things and want them, but, because I don't 
have the faculties, my experience is very different, and I am not 
prompted in that way like that person. In other words: my shit is broke.
 I mean, that's the kind of thing that happens when you're a Level 99 
Alchemist. Your concoctions are very effective. They have very serious 
consequences on the innermost constitution of a human being. So, too, do
 my concoctions have very serious consequences. Because of my tinkering,
 my shit is <i>broke. </i>It just is.<br><br></div>however! This is definitely <i>not the end of the story. </i>You see, these faculties are not by any means the <i>only </i>faculties
 which will help to provoke me to work and set some shit up for myself, 
nor is separating myself from these faculties my only available method 
of keeping myself safe. Rather, this measure I have taken is <i>entirely temporary </i>--
 a sloppy tourniquet intended merely to keep me from bleeding out on my 
way to the hospital. Once I am there, though, this is precisely what 
will happen: the <i>Lord, </i>the <i>master surgeon, </i>will be very perceptible and real to me, just like my <i>thing </i>is
 very real to me now. As a result, my incentive to do good will increase
 dramatically, and my incentive to bite the devil's hook will likewise 
diminish. I will be much less vulnerable from this position, and I will 
also be prompted to handle my business by much greater and more reliable
 means than I otherwise would've. And my wound, thereby, will be healed.<br><div><div><br></div><div>make no mistake, dear: <i>you </i>are
 driving the ambulance. I will hobble there on my own. I will get there,
 but I will hobble. It's not because I'm lazy, or because I'm an 
asshole. I know it isn't. It's because you serve to make the journey 
appetizing in a way that less tangible and less immediate incentive 
cannot do for me, and, by that mechanism, I fucking cut through traffic 
like it's not even there, dude. I know this is not what you want to 
hear. But I know I owe you this explanation, and I am obligated to give 
it to you.<br><br>have.<br></div><div><div><br><br><br><br></div></div></div></div></font></div></table></table></div></div>
