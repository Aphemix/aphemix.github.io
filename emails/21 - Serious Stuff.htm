 am regretful to have opened up to you on a physically intimate level 
only to draw myself back, but I feel it in my bones that I am incapable 
of committing. And if I can't whole-heartedly commit, then I shouldn't 
do it. It's not fair to either of us.</div><div dir=ltr>I have a 
strong connection with you. It was very wonderful being there with you. I
 was very submersed in the moment. And I treasure the moment. I am sad 
that I didn't give you and that moment all due respect by allowing trust
 to to take shape. I should not have agreed to lay with you. I know we 
have sparks flying. I know there is love and attraction. I know I was 
eager to experience sharing that when I agreed to lay with you.</div><div><br></div><div>When
 I have time to myself, I can perceive myself in a way that I feel is 
unclouded. I can't describe the incredible soundness of the feeling 
running through the core of me that tells me yes, or no, or red light, 
green light. But I believe in it. I believe that it is my core 
connection with God, and a guiding light. When I follow it, a chain of 
events happen that bewilder me and have me in complete awe of God and 
the unfathomably beautiful plan for all of creation, and it builds my 
faith.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div dir=ltr>I'm happy on my own now.
 I value this as a time for self discovery. It feels right. I want to 
follow through with it. I don't want to cut it short with a 
relationship. I'm not in the time and place to be with someone. When I 
am ready, and the aligning person is there, it will feel right and I 
will know it's right. With you and I, I have love for you, but our 
values are not in alignment. I wish they were. But there's nothing to be
 forced.</div><div><br></div><div dir=ltr>I started writing this email
 on Friday. It's a hard time. I don't feel that it's complete in the 
least bit, but I don't want to leave you hanging for more time while I'm
 compiling a message with difficulty. So I'm just gonna send it as is. 
It gives you at least a chunk of my thinking. I'm mostly thinking I need
 space.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Please take time to respond in a non-argumentative manner. otherwise, I can't deal. It's heavy.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>I
 hope you had a nice weekend, despite not hearing from a Bekah. I had a 
fun, busy Saturday. And yesterday I stayed in from the snow and freezing
 rain.</div><div><br></div></div></div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Mon, Mar 2, 2015 at 5:37 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr>all right. No arguing. I'm going to tell you some things, so that you have them.<br><br>I
 want you to recall when you were a child. I'm sure you had beliefs, 
preferences, expectations -- things you accepted as truths about 
yourself or about the world, all of which I'm sure were very real and 
meaningful to you as a child. What happened to them? I'm guessing it's 
the same thing that happens to everyone's: people encounter a 
progressively larger amount of data as time passes and they age. They 
develop broader perspectives, perspectives that had previously eluded 
them due to the requisite information being inaccessible to them at 
those earlier times. And, although they may formerly have entertained 
all manner of seemingly meaningful fancy, in light of this new 
information, it is revealed that those fancies just aren't as meaningful
 or as important as they had seemed. Suddenly: poof! They vanish. 
They're gone. So it is with everyone and the fancies of their 
childhoods.<br><br>the way we are as children is not "real" -- in the 
sense that it is transient and circumstantial, inevitably fading away, 
being replaced by something more accurately suited to reality following 
the introduction of more relevant data and greater understanding. It is 
not representative of our <i>real self. </i>Of course, this doesn't keep
 it from feeling completely real to us at the time. Indeed, at the time,
 our childhoods are our only frames of reference: it only makes sense 
that we would trust the feelings and beliefs our childhoods produce, as 
those feelings and beliefs are perfectly suited to us from within the 
context of our own childhoods. Yet we are more than our frames of 
reference. No matter the frame of reference, we are more.<br><br>I don't
 mean to patronize you. But I want you to imagine a scenario where -- 
rather than being exposed to the world as a child; rather than coming to
 develop a broader perspective of reality and maturing; rather than <i>adapting </i>to what was <i>indicated </i>by that perspective -- your experiential data came not from <i>reality, </i>but from your <i>own </i>frame
 of reference. Imagine if your parents were only your parents if they 
did what you asked, for example. Imagine if your peers were only your 
peers if you liked them, and candy was the only food. What do you think 
would have happened to your childhood fancies in this alternate 
universe? Would they have faded away with age? Would you have grown into
 a balanced and a healthy adult? Or would the experiences that would 
ordinarily have compelled you to <i>change </i>and <i>make room </i>instead simply be made <i>powerless, </i>leaving
 you no reason to progress except for whatever weird stories you thought
 to tell yourself about your fake parents and your make-believe life? I 
am thinking it is the latter and not the former, there, friend. I am 
thinking things would not turn out so well in that universe at all.<br><br>you
 speak very often and very highly of your inner guidance. You speak of 
its consistency, and of how it resonates with your self and your 
feelings. I understand that. I <i>promise </i>I don't mean to patronize you. But I want you to understand the <i>self </i>is not nearly such a static thing as you seem to suppose. Rather: there is the <i>present </i>self, which is the self that entertains the childhood fancies, and then there is the <i>real </i>self, of which the present self is only a <i>small part. </i>The present self, of course, is the one we experience. That's how it works down here -- as long as we're stuck in this <i>craphole, </i>where <i>time exists </i>n' shit, we are going to experience the present. Pretty basic. Now, what that means is that, when we feel things that seem <i>consistent </i>with ourselves, and when we <i>want </i>things, we only want them from the perspective of the <i>present self, </i>because that's <i>who we are </i>at the time. I mean, it's normal! There's nothing wrong with it! However, it should be noted that, unless you're just an <i>asshole, </i>the desires of the present self and those of the real self are <i>very unlikely to coincide. </i>You can look at any child's desires at any time and see some pretty indisputable evidence that this is true. The <i>reason </i>it is true is because the present self is <i>always </i>at odds with the real self. The present self wants to <i>preserve </i>itself,
 you see. It wants to perpetuate what it wants. But in order to attain 
to a greater degree of similarity to the real self, the present self, by
 definition, <i>must go, </i>and <i>must </i>cease to exist. Because of 
this dynamic, the present self and its desires are very unlikely to be 
reliable indicators of what the real self wants. That's just how it is.<br><br>I
 am no stranger at all to this inner guidance of yours, nor am I 
unfamiliar with the way things magically fall into place upon your 
correctly following this guidance. I was once where you are, you see. I 
followed my guidance, too. As a result, I experienced what Jung the 
occultist termed synchronicity -- those things magically falling into 
place and seemingly showing my next steps to me all by themselves. 
Indeed, very often, almost <i>continuously, </i>I experienced this: I was very passionate, and I was very good at it. Of course, I thought it was <i>God, </i>too, when I was doing it. I was so very <i>spiritual. </i>And
 the harder I worked to go where this process of discovery led, the more
 misleading spiritual data I exposed myself to, believing it was good. 
That is: the farther I went, the more thoroughly I made myself 
vulnerable to deluding spiritual influence -- to the influence of 
demons. And as this happened, so too did my belief get more false, and 
so too did my means of determining the truth grow ever more obscure.<br><br>I
 am no stranger at all to this inner guidance of yours, nor is it merely
 my own history that leads me to be distrustful of such things. I'm a 
secret agent, remember? For years and years I have been moved along from
 job to job, meeting this person and that who is entangled in some way 
by this <i>same </i>deluding spiritual influence -- this influence that 
my experiences and my input just happen to be uniquely useful in 
counteracting and healing. This is <i>why I'm here. </i>This is, without
 a doubt, my area of expertise and my career. Do you think your inner 
guidance is unique? Do you think I am able to say what I say on the 
basis of <i>your </i>actions <i>alone? </i>Hardly. I have seen 
situations exactly like yours many dozens upon dozens of times, my dear.
 I have evaluated them and compared them against one another with the 
same competence and accuracy with which I have evaluated you, yourself, 
as I've known you. Each of these people are all accompanied by the same 
red flags: the same beliefs; the same characteristics. The same 
astrology, the same parallel dimensions quantum physics blah blah blah, 
the same such and such <i>energy, </i>the same "colors" and "auras", the
 same attributing meaning and healing power to things like amethyst 
necklaces and henna paste. The same Reiki and Tarot readings. The same 
responses to coincidences and synchronicities. The same mania. Not to 
mention the <i>much more precise similarities </i>between areas of your 
personalities and your minds that you wouldn't even grasp if I were to 
describe them to you. There are many. Either way, I promise you, your 
actions alone are not at all the defining reason I tell you what I tell 
you. Not by a longshot. Your shit is <i>textbook, </i>and I <i>have the book.&nbsp; </i><br><br>I
 am no stranger at all to this inner guidance of yours, nor does my 
conviction start and end with a handful of attributes I am checking off 
some checklist. No: I also understand <i>where </i>your inner guidance has <i>come from, </i>and <i>exactly </i>how it <i>works. </i>You
 see, it is no coincidence at all that so many others with your outlook 
and your same manner of experiencing yourself manage to <i>also </i>possess these <i>same </i>attributes and be associated with these <i>same </i>red flags. It is no coincidence: it is precisely these things that <i>cause </i>your
 inner guidance to appear and be perceived more convincingly from within
 your own mind. That is, your belief in astrology, your reading others 
according to their colors and their energies, and whatever else -- 
though these things may seem harmless, they are not at all harmless, 
just as the child perceiving according to his own frame of reference is 
not harmless. Rather, these approaches, these things <i>you do, </i>were each <i>invented deliberately </i>by <i>spirits, </i>and they were invented for the specific purpose that, upon practicing them, <i>your mind </i>would
 subtly come to do the will of these spirits -- culminating in the 
complete replacement of your own will by theirs. This shit is <i>not </i>a
 joke, dude. Do you remember when I told you that, one day, we would see
 demons manifesting openly, claiming to be our future selves, telling us
 what we must do in order to progress in our spiritual evolution and so 
on? You said it scared you. I don't blame you. Do you not understand 
that what you are undergoing <i>right now </i>is merely a less overt prototype of that <i>very same approach </i>-- and that, by your inner guidance, you are being prepared to <i>believe them </i>when they appear to you? It is only <i>because </i>of the power you give them that they will even be <i>able </i>to appear. Tell me: am I lying? I would not lie.<br><br>I'm
 just going to come out and say this, dude. That thing you think is God 
is actually from the devil. I'm not guessing; I'm sure. This is not the 
type of bad judgment call someone in my position is even capable of 
making. I'm just sure and that's it. I am way beyond sure. You need to 
understand: you are not able to defend yourself against these things, 
nor will you even have the ability to identify them dependably, except 
by the Holy Spirit of God and by no other measure. That's just how it 
works. Indeed, it seems you are even predisposed to give power to these 
things and draw them to yourself for as long as you continue to rely on 
your own competence. Don't get me wrong: I pray, and I'll keep praying, 
and I'll tell you what's up as often as I feel I'm able to do it, but I 
can't stop you from doing what you're doing, and that <i>is </i>what you're doing. I don't even know what else to say.<br><br>if you even managed to read this far, cool. Let me just tell you what's up.<br><br>I'm sorry we got too frisky. Really, I am. I should've known better. I don't blame you for your space. Take it.<br><br>love is the thing that draws the present self to the real self. It's the <i>only </i>thing. Trust me bitch. I've tried <i>all the things.&nbsp; </i><br><br>we
 don't want different things. Honest. It's just this: I don't want shit 
unless love wants it too. And you don't know what you want yet.<br><br>okay, I'm done. Hurry up. Freakin' retard. I love you baby.<br><br>&lt;3<br><br></div>

 culmination of Jung's lifelong engagement with the paranormal is his 
theory of synchronicity, the view that the structure of reality includes
 a principle of acausal connection which manifests itself most 
conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult, flawed,
 prone to misrepresentation, this theory none the less remains one of 
the most suggestive attempts yet made to bring the paranormal within the
 bounds of intelligibility. It has been found relevant by 
psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of spiritual experience
 and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in 
this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of 
the paranormal."<br><br>"Synchronicity was a principle which, Jung felt,
 gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of archetypes and the 
collective unconscious. It described a governing dynamic which underlies
 the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, 
psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic 
paradigm was a significant move away from Cartesian dualism towards an 
underlying philosophy of double-aspect theory. It has been argued that 
this shift was essential to bringing theoretical coherence to Jung's 
earlier work."<br><br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung target=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<wbr>Carl_Jung</a><br><br>"Jung
 created some of the best known psychological concepts, including the 
archetype, the collective unconscious, the complex, and synchronicity. 
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular psychometric 
instrument, and the concepts of socionics were developed from Jung's 
theory of psychological types."<br><br>"Though he was a practising 
clinician and considered himself to be a scientist, much of his life's 
work was spent exploring tangential areas such as Eastern and Western 
philosophy, alchemy, astrology, and sociology, as well as literature and
 the arts. Jung's interest in philosophy and the occult led many to view
 him as a mystic, although his ambition was to be seen as a man of 
science. His influence on popular psychology, the "psychologization of 
religion", spirituality and the New Age movement has been immense."<br><br>"In
 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible 
"confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. 
He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a
 schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in 
private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, "active 
imaginations". He recorded everything he felt in small journals. Jung 
began to transcribe his notes into a large red leather-bound book, on 
which he worked intermittently for sixteen years."<br><br>"Jung emerged 
from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-teens with the 
publication of several journal articles, followed in 1921 with 
Psychological Types, one of his most influential books. There followed a
 decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels."<br><br>"Jung
 continued to publish books until the end of his life, including Flying 
Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies (1959), which 
analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance 
of the reported observations of UFOs."<br><br></div>etc. etc.<br></div></font></div></table></table></div></div>
