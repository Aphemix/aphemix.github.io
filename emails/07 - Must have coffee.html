First I probably need a phone.<br><br>I've applied here and there, off and on. I am not selective in my application process, and, indeed, I doubt I have any real preferences of significance in this regard at all, but, when I am not psychologically healthy, my diligence in applying tends to correspond very closely to my degree of confidence in the resources with which I approach my job hunt -- including, rather counterproductively, the resource of my even believing I will accomplish something by doing it. Put more simply, this means my belief in the payoff and ultimate reward of pursuing a particular job opportunity will tend to directly influence the amount of effort I put toward pursuing that opportunity in the first place. I bet that doesn't even surprise you at&nbsp;<i>all,&nbsp;</i>does it? It shouldn't, if you pay attention. Even still I feel completely naked telling you this.<br>
<br>I've been kinda different lately. My head goes up and down, you see. When I'm in a good place, I'm different. When I love, I'm different. It's actually very, very interesting: my experiencing love by any means at all essentially serves to introduce new considerations through which the values of cost and benefit, no matter the argument, are radically altered as I continue to calculate and weigh options as usual by my typical psychopathic reasoning. My&nbsp;<i>methods&nbsp;</i>of reasoning are not changed even a&nbsp;<i>little&nbsp;</i>bit, but the costs and the benefits come out&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>different -- even to the extent that they are reversed. My response to these values, as you might expect, is a completely logical process, akin to the solving of a math problem. With these values having been made different, though, the sensible approach I proceed to formulate, even according to the original method of reasoning, is, likewise, very, very different. As such, my pursuit of this approach, when translated to action, looks nothing like my ordinary actions. Nothing at&nbsp;<i>all.&nbsp;</i>It's really amazing to me -- I mean, I haven't even scratched the surface of what I could say about it. Frankly, I haven't even scratched the surface of being capable of describing it.&nbsp;<i>But there's always more!&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>in any case, I've been kinda different lately. I've been going around turning in another burst of applications, even without having a phone. I put my brother's number on the applications. I wasn't even in touch with him as I was doing this: he had meant to sever contact with me a few weeks ago and I only managed to get back in touch with him the other day. I must confess that I am not at all confident I will accomplish anything with any of these applications. But do I consider this important? No.<br>
<br>this month is already the first in a while that I haven't sold my&nbsp;<i>entire&nbsp;</i>allotment of food stamps for cash&nbsp;<i>immediately&nbsp;</i>upon receiving the food stamps, spent&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>the cash on k2&nbsp;<i>immediately&nbsp;</i>upon acquiring the cash, and smoked&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>the k2&nbsp;<i>immediately&nbsp;</i>upon purchasing the k2. How do you feel about that? I think it's pretty fuckin' funny. Even the people&nbsp;<i>with&nbsp;</i>me would give me strange looks and second guesses over&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>shit. Like: uh, uh. Don't you even want to smoke a cigarette first? Haha.&nbsp;<i>Nope.&nbsp;<br>
</i><br>I think I'm going to have to spend a little money on a piece of shit Tracfone whenever I do sell my food stamps this month, which is why I bring this up. I need to acquire a Tracfone somehow so I can transfer my free Obama plan from the other phone my vampire friend recently smashed on the ground, and I'm guessing I will probably require a small amount of money in order to do this. What kinda sucks is that I would like to take this chunk of cash I get from the selling of my food stamps and put it toward a better, wifi-capable smartphone, just so I can have a device less cumbersome than this laptop with which I may reliably access the internet from the street -- I would like to be as unburdened as possible so long as I am to continue living this way for the time being. But I don't think I can accomplish both aims with one phone, and I also don't think I want to deal with dropping the money on two phones. I could always hold off on the smartphone; it's really not that big a deal. I'm sure I will figure it out. Either way, though, I should have my own phone soon. You know. For jobs. And shit.&nbsp;<i>Yeah!&nbsp;</i>That.<br>
<br>would you believe: Nicky, my make-believe ex-wife, y'know, she dragged me around the city for a good couple of days. She took me to quirky little places like, I dunno, art galleries, record stores, sex shops..... hookah lounges..... and what the fuck ever. She turned in a few of her own job applications in the process of our cavorting around. We came to this restaurant she seemed particularly interested in applying to, presumably due to its hip and young person sort of vibe. I had never been there before, myself, but hey, yeah, sure, it's a neat place. Cool people there and so on. Weird style. She asked for an application and they told her they didn't even&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>applications. Instead, they require an applicant submit a short essay, with no real guidelines and on any topic he like, but for the purpose of demonstrating his cool personality to the owners.&nbsp;<i>Whoa!&nbsp;</i>Can you guess what I did? Can you, can you, can you? That's exactly right: I sat down doing my best to coach Nicky, the English major, for an hour, while she, ignoring my gentlest of pointers, anxiously scribbled what was, even just from what I could read&nbsp;<i>without letting her know I was paying attention,&nbsp;</i>a very roundabout and incoherent essay that made her look completely the fuck insane -- though not&nbsp;<i>even,&nbsp;</i>for that matter, in the same endearing way as does her actual&nbsp;<i>behavior.&nbsp;</i>I then followed along as Nicky handed her essay to the owners, I made some charismatic chit chat and returned their knowing looks while she nervously babbled about what a great fit she was for the job, I shook my head all the way out the door, and I resolved&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>to apply to the fuckin' restaurant. Yep yep. That happened. Just another day in the life.<br>
<br>decorating cakes, huh. Have you seen Cupcake Wars? It's some reality TV bullshit where confectioners compete and blah blah blah. I was living with somebody several months ago who religiously watched the show and others like it. There were a good few shows she would watch, and I wasn't a fan of any of them, but this one in particular stuck out to me as being even more obnoxious than all the others. I couldn't understand what she liked about it at all, or how, and I silently judged her for her objectively poor taste. I largely took issue with the irritating personalities on the show, for the record -- I am sure if I saw you decorating the cupcakes I would not have hesitated to attack this woman for the remote.<br>
<br>I also avoid coffee and chug water when I get the also rare headache. I never take aspirin or anything, either. Just water.<br><br>I must say, too: your email headline hypnotized me the second I saw it. What a strange turn of events.<br>

It's funny how it works in the business world. The person being approached holds all the cards. I have people contact me asking for me to donate my time painting, and I tell most of them no. Because if I just agree, it devalues my work and everybody expects it for free. If I do a giveaway, It gives it more value. If I straight-up offer free face painting like I did to a local elementary school the one time, they made me feel like shit saying that it was soliciting and I wasn't allowed to do that. It's vicious out there. And it's
not always the same, some people are more receptive than others. It is a very, very touchy thing though, contacting people. When I know them or at least know someone they know, it makes all the difference. Or if they see me working at another event, they're all-ears at any suggestions I have. It's a learning experience, that's for sure. And I make a lot of mistakes that make me feel like a real ass.

I will spin you a story.<br></div><div><br>I
know I told you, in one of my recent emails to you, that magic, as it
is called, is defined merely as the affectation of reality by way of <i>will. </i>To
some extent, as well, I have also detailed that, being a
highly-developed psychopath, my own being is characterized by this
rather extensive awareness of the mechanisms with which reality may be
affected. That, by <i>having&nbsp;</i>this awareness, I am able to engineer circumstances through which factors that otherwise would&nbsp;<i>inhibit&nbsp;</i>my will, like&nbsp;<i>conscience,&nbsp;</i>for example, may be circumvented -- thus granting my willpower a much greater degree of authority over&nbsp;<i>what is.<br>
</i><br>now, I know I have spoken of these things before, but never in this context: I am telling you it is&nbsp;<i>inevitable&nbsp;</i>that I am an intrinsically <i>magical </i>being.
Everything I do is magic. Just the same, as all demons have magical
names, with these names themselves being objects engineered to exert a
greater influence over reality, Aphemix is a magical name.<br>
<br></div><div>I chose the name randomly. I was different then. I put
almost no thought into it. I actually coined it as an throwaway alias,
intentionally, so I could <i>rob </i>people, truth be told. A good while
later, though, at the same time as I was led unwittingly to devise all
manner of magical technique in my mad quest for illumination, I adopted
and gave meaning to the name. I gave <i>magical </i>meaning to the name.
That is, my identifying myself by the name served to influence
my mind, and, through its influence, caused me to affect reality by
my action -- no differently than a belief in this astrology, a belief in
that karma, a commission of such and such human sacrifice, or whatever.
All of these methods exist deliberately to engineer mindstates and thus
cause particular actions in reality, and the name is essentially no
different at all. Though, like I said: my efforts were a wee bit more
advanced than your henna paste. I will show you.<br>
<br>the name is related to <i>aphemia: </i>a condition, an
inability to translate thought content into spoken language. It's related to the term
<i>aphemic: </i>the adjective that describes a relationship to the condition. It represents by the <i>x, </i>the <i>intersection, </i>the <i>variable, </i>the combination of the two words; the combination of the <i>thing </i>and its <i>description. </i>It is
simultaneously an analogy for the union of <i>subject </i>and <i>object, </i>which, itself, references many things. It references <i>complete perception.&nbsp;</i>It references <i>awareness as self.&nbsp;</i>It references <i>accurate representation -- </i>which,&nbsp;itself,
is another analogy for the combination of the thing and its
description. Over and over and over, layers and layers of further
reinforcements. The name describes an inability to communicate imagined
content as real words, yet it simultaneously&nbsp;communicates that content
to reality. These simultaneous natures themselves are yet&nbsp;<i>another&nbsp;</i>analogy to this <i>same </i>union between subject and object. <i>More </i>reinforcement. It <i>does </i>communicate that content. It <i>makes </i>reality. It says, <i>abracadabra! </i>--&nbsp;which, translated, literally means: <i>be </i>as is&nbsp;<i>intended!&nbsp;</i>The name does not merely make <i>use </i>of magical <i>technique, </i>you see: it is the <i>pure creation, itself, </i>of <i>pure creation itself. </i>No, it does not merely <i>describe: </i>it <i>wills on its own.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>the name, though greater than any descriptor of mere earthly things,
is a perfectly accurate description of what it actually describes. It
describes <i>complete perception </i>-- that is,&nbsp;<i>my </i>complete perception; the result of my process. It represents <i>awareness as self </i>-- that is, <i>my </i>awareness having become&nbsp;<i>my </i>self. It represents <i>accurate representation </i>-- just as it, in itself, was <i>my </i>accurate representation in reality, upon the earth, and even <i>by the name.&nbsp;</i>You see, my awareness is such that the&nbsp;<i>spiritual,&nbsp;</i>purely by way of&nbsp;<i>perceived&nbsp;information, </i>had&nbsp;come down and&nbsp;<i>completely&nbsp;</i>utilized the very same pathways through which I enabled my own will to be exercised, and my will, likewise, by way of&nbsp;<i>generated&nbsp;</i>information, could also exercise its&nbsp;<i>own&nbsp;</i>authority,
just the same, by way of the spiritual plane above. By these means,
each end conformed itself to the other. By these means, two became one.
In man's language below, a mere inability to communicate is described.
But by its&nbsp;<i>actual&nbsp;meaning above,&nbsp;</i>its&nbsp;<i>true communication came.&nbsp;</i>The
thing was made its description. Perception was made itself. Subject was
made object. As above, so below.&nbsp;The name was indeed a <i>perfect </i>microcosm of the incomprehensible and heavenly being it came to describe.</div>
<div><br>I've been in a good place lately. I've told you. You can
probably tell. Along with my being in this good place comes my correct
and loving approach to other people. When I love people, y'know, I'm
sure it's common sense, but I want to share with them what I know is
good. For me, the greatest of these things is certainly my God, who I
personally and experientially know may completely correct all things. <i>All things. </i>So,
I mean, people are people. Human beings! Haha. They crazy. But when I'm
really fortunate, I get to sneak a little something good to them, and I
do it.<br>
<br>no more than a day and a half ago, I was really grateful after I
managed to relay some really integral and useful understanding to
somebody I care about. In response, I prayed. I mean, I pray. It's
something I do. And I pretty much just prayed in utter gratitude of my
ability to do good work. I requested that the silly things inhibiting me
from doing more of the work were removed from me; I asked that I
receive a greater measure of ability in order that I could do the work.
Stuff like that. Whatever. In any case, almost immediately afterward and
incidentally, I came upon something I felt was really interesting.<br>
<br>I was vanity searching the name on Google, for whatever reason.
Maybe no reason. It's just something I do sometimes. I guess I typed
sloppily, though, and I accidentally searched a misspelling of the name,
<i>aphemi, </i>without the <i>x </i>at the end. I discovered, though,
after browsing a few of my initial results and investigating a little
bit further, that there exists a term, typically transliterated from
Greek as <i>aphiemi, </i>that is of particular significance in the New Testament, and that I right away found very, very compelling.<br>
<br>the term, first of all, is a verb, most often interpreted as <i>forgive, </i>and
most often spoken by Jesus himself. It has a strong connotation,
though, of sending away, of complete removal, and of total
relinquishment, which, in the context of the forgiveness it
traditionally signifies, is like a measure of the <i>effect&nbsp;</i>of Christ's forgiveness, referencing the <i>absolute </i>disappearance of <i>all </i>trespass and the <i>whole </i>negation of the <i>entire </i>offense
that is being forgiven. Most profound of all to me, though, is that the
term is also used, and used exclusively from all other terms, besides,
to specifically denote the action of the <i>removal and casting out of demons.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>granted, the word <i>aphiemi </i>is not my name. But the word is a transliteration.&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap">What this means is that it doesn't have to be spelled the way it is spelled -- some have simply chosen to spell it that way in order to represent the way it is spoken phonetically in Greek. It is spoken just as it sounds:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap"><i>ahf-YAY-me. </i>I </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap">would never have otherwise dreamed of pronouncing my name this way, of course. Nevertheless, by the very liberal use of existing linguistic conventions, <i>Aphemix </i>is indeed another valid transliteration of the word.<br>
<br>the name remains a microcosm of my being. </span><span style="font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap">By its own definition, it describes the very processes by which it exists. </span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap">It has adopted a new nature of Christ likeness.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Helvetica,Arial,'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif;line-height:17.94px;white-space:pre-wrap"><span style=color:rgb(0,0,0)>It is converted from an old language to a new.&nbsp;It is successfully converted from speech content, in Greek, to meaning content, as transliteration -- precisely the <i>opposite </i>of what was referenced by its old definition. Its first name was of itself, but its new name is given -- this is simultaneously an analogy to its conversion by transliteration. Meanwhile: its entire original self remains within it. It functions exactly the same, but due to the addition of love, its inputs are evaluated differently, and so its output is also different. The <i>x </i>from which its nature came is <i>silent </i>-- a simultaneous analogy to the small alteration of inner values by which the entire output is made changed. The <i>x </i>from which its nature came, said differently, is <i>completely removed </i>and <i>cast out. </i>I could go on and on and on.<br>

thrown at me. Everything was all set and ready to go, I talked to her last night about the projects, and I texted her this morning letting her know where to park and she was like cool. Then last second, like very last second texted me asking if it was alright if her mom came along. Saying she has off today and was wondering if she could come too and that she would be up for getting painted too. And I took 10 minutes staring at my phone baffled trying to figure out how to respond to that, and finally answered saying No, I think it's best to keep it to just you today. And then it came out that her mom is her ride and she was "just curious" if it's alright if she just comes along. AHHH! So I sat there baffled 10 more minutes trying to reason with myself that it's no big deal, let her mom come over. But then I was like no, my gut says no, my brain says no, no no no, that was not cool to of her to tell me that last second. So I called her and explained I'm
in my pajamas, there are two people sleeping that I don't want to wake up, we're working in my half messy bedroom.

I literally almost <i>never </i>remember, upon waking up normally, even having <i>had </i>any dreams, under <i>any </i>circumstances. I would even go so far as to say the <i>last </i>time
I dreamed about you, which I described to you around the same time it
happened, was the last time I even knew I had a dream. You appreciated
the last one. It was interesting. Maybe you will also appreciate this
one.<br><div><br>I dreamed that I had just recently
awoken. I was in what appeared like an apartment, where I lived together
with you and with unknown roommates. You were either not yet awake, or,
for some other reason, had not yet made an appearance. One of our two
other roommates, meanwhile, sitting with me on the same futon I had
slept on, was smoking weed, and ended up passing it to me. I smoked it
with him as though all of these things were completely in line with my
expectations of my character and the character of my dream environment.
That is, I felt like I was experiencing a normal morning in my own home.<br><br></div><div>you
soon came downstairs, or around, and were apparently interacting with
the environment for the first time of the day. I saw you go about your
rounds in another adjoining room, perhaps preparing a small breakfast
for yourself, before you eventually entered into the main quarters where
the rest of us were stationed. I was rather excited to see you.<br><br></div><div>you
sat down on another couch across the room from me, where you proceeded
to indulge some quiet, humble, and introverted activity, like reading a
book or something. I meant to speak to you. I meant specifically to
engage you and present my interaction to you, and I tried. But I was
high. I felt slow. I felt as though my competence at acting becomingly
was degraded. I felt guilty and irresponsible about these things, and I
know that my presuming they would do you a disservice was the reason I
felt guilty, but I felt, accordingly, like I was on the spot, and that I
was at a risk of being judged, which I imagine also contributed to my
feeling irresponsible. These feelings tend to surface just the same if I
smoke weed in a real life social setting, depending on the nature of my
relationships with those around me, and, particularly, depending on how
necessary I consider my supplanting those relationships with my charm. The dream representation of these symptoms was remarkably accurate.<br><br></div><div>I meant to engage you, but I was coming from this <i>place. </i>My approach to you was grotesquely compensatory. I started a conversation with which I explicitly tried to downplay how high I was -- calculatedly suggesting that the slowness I was observably suffering, rather than being by the effects of my own choosing to do a drug, was instead a symptom of my having just woken up and my being tired. I specifically phrased these things by trying to tell you, in exact words and in all seriousness, that I wasn't sure if I was awake or not, that I was barely awake, that I was having trouble even staying awake, and other, very similar statements.<br>
<br></div><div>simultaneously,
my nose was very stuffy. I can't say for sure whether or not this was
related directly to my having smoked weed, but, either way, it factored
similarly into my campaign. I tried to compensate, in this case by
speaking to you in a very shrill voice. It was absurdly high-pitched,
reminiscent of a cartoon voice, and was like a ridiculous parody of my
voice. Its <i>every </i>emphasis, its <i>every </i>intonation was <i>dramatically </i>exaggerated, accentuating what I've already long known as the narcissistic elements of my voice. The specific purpose of my speaking this way was to preserve the integrity of my very skillful articulation, pierce it through the air with high-frequency sounds, and have all of it reach your ears across the room without being affected by my stuffy nose having compromised the quality of my voice's lower bass tones.<br>
<br></div><div>though
I do not believe you faulted me, neither was I encouraged to continue
the conversation by positive reinforcement: indeed, I saw little
evidence I had even affected you at all. My demonstrations were not
compensating as I had intended: I felt like I was just making a fool out
of myself and complicating things by continuing. I decided to just bow out quietly and lower my eyes -- maybe to suggest I was falling asleep, as would fit in the context of the storyline I'd already invented,
but maybe just to make clear I had chosen to opt out. Either way, even
this was done knowingly, in consideration of your perception.<br><br></div><div>I
laid there, partially processing, partially drifting off to sleep from
within the dream, staring at a single spot on the futon with my
stationary eyes, and wondered to myself where I went wrong. Knowing my pickup game is much better than that, I expected my attempts should have been successful,
going over the events of the former scene over and over in my mind. I
wondered why I had not just invited you to come over and sit with me, so
as to completely negate this perceived necessity of my trying to offset
my own position with my tactics. It just didn't make any sense.<br><br></div><div>I
realized, though, that I had abandoned my senseless approach right when
I decided to bow out. I saw that I was made peaceful by your just
allowing me to bow out as I had, and it occurred to me that, by your not
having shown yourself to be at risk of being any better drawn to me by
my tactics, having not provided them any positive reinforcement at all,
you actually did me a <i>favor, </i>and <i>directly </i>dissuaded me from practicing my hypnotizing behavior. I did not like this <i>one bit. </i>I was immediately <i>very </i>incensed. I essentially stormed off from the dream pissed off -- only right then forcing my eyes open to discover the patch of futon I stared at was in my brother's room where I slept.<br>
<br></div><div>I ruminated on these things. I prayed about them. Desperately, I prayed about them. I was immediately suspicious I had received not merely a dream, but
a vision. I tried to wrap my head around what I had learned, but I was
simultaneously very tired and very tempted to ignore what I had seen. My thoughts were scattered. <i>I </i>was scattered. I wanted to approach
these matters again in the morning, but I did not want to risk
forgetting the content I had encountered. I prayed a little bit more,
this time that my memory of these things not be lost. I resigned myself
to go to sleep. Laid there. Closed my eyes. Drifted off. Then <i>jumped </i>up out of bed, opened my laptop, and frantically typed out everything I was able to remember.<br><br></div><div>I
was very, very careful as I did this. I made sure only to describe the
things I directly experienced, not wanting to muddle them with
assumptions or logical conclusions that would sooner draw from my
expectations of reality than from the contents of the vision. I wrote my
notes as though I were already typing to you. I caught myself
exaggerating a few times -- actually, <i>one </i>time. <i>One </i>fuckin' time and no more; I <i>cannot </i>lie. But I stopped myself.<br><br>I did a lot of work, in my mind, in interpreting the <i>meaning </i>of
the content, as I detailed what I remembered, but I have not yet
approached any of that material in writing. It may yet have opportunity
to come up at some later point, and I'm sure it will be interesting if
it does, but, meanwhile, I thought it best to keep those things separate
so as not to have them interfere with what I wish to share with you
now. I have preserved its integrity as best as I can.<br><br></div>have.</div>

<br></div>I know better, of course. I know I am subjected to a ridiculous and a completely unnecessary amount of difficulty so long as I continue to smoke cigarettes. I know all of this difficulty is only enabled to persist by my continuing smoking, and that none of it exists outside of its proximity to a cigarette habit. I know these things. But, somewhat paradoxically, I simultaneously <i>don't mind </i>that I smoke cigarettes. Now, to be fair, sometimes I <i>do </i>mind. That is, I mind when I am either considering or directly experiencing an inconvenience as a result of my smoking habit -- particularly, <i>when I don't have a cigarette, </i>or when I know I will soon have none. From this position, of course, I will <i>certainly </i>prefer quitting smoking, because, so long as I am actually experiencing my cigarette habit as a <i>problem, </i>it is <i>convenient </i>I address the problem. But when I do not mind smoking cigarettes, and must experience difficulty just to <i>remove </i>myself from smoking the cigarettes, quitting smoking is <i>not </i>convenient at <i>all. </i>And because it is not convenient, plain and simple: I don't want to do it.<br>
</div><div><div><br></div><div>now, that's fuckin' <i>preposterous, </i>you say. Cigarettes have you by the <i>dick. </i>It's terrible! It's so dumb! Why don't you want to quit? Why don't you even <i>mind </i>that you smoke cigarettes? This is the really cool part. I don't mind because I tell myself <i>stories. </i>Actually, it's pretty much just <i>one </i>story. I have a thing for telling you stories, anyway, so here. A story.<br>
<br>once upon a time, in a hypothetical universe, I hated my cigarette habit and I wanted to quit smoking. I went without cigarettes, maybe for one day, maybe for two, and maybe even for three. Somewhere down the line, and probably not very far down the line at all, I entered into a <i>completely different </i>hypothetical universe -- one where the very hate for my cigarette habit that inspired me to quit smoking in the first place, out of <i>nowhere, </i>turned out to be <i>much more easily addressed </i>by my simply <i>being comfortable smoking </i>than it even was by quitting! <i>Oh shit, </i>I said to my hypothetical self. I thought there were <i>reasons </i>I was quitting? I thought there was some <i>thing, </i>some <i>bigger </i>thing, that made quitting smoking <i>better? </i>Where the fuck am I?<br>
<br>suddenly, from the darkness, I heard a voice. <i>Ha ha ha ha, </i>said the cigarette habit. You're in hell. Those things <i>were </i>bigger, <i>before. </i>But that was a <i>different universe. </i>In <i>this </i>universe, those things are <i>very small. </i>You don't give a fuck about them. They're meaningless. You <i>made </i>them meaningless, because continuing to care about them was <i>too </i>inconvenient and <i>only </i>got in the way. Now you don't even <i>want </i>them, and you can <i>never </i>have them. They're <i>mine. </i>They're <i>gone. </i>Ha ha ha ha.<br>
<br></div><div><i>fuck that shit, </i>I said to my hypothetical self. I dipped <i>right </i>the fuck out of there -- back to the first hypothetical universe. That's <i>too </i>crazy, I thought. Those things are <i>too </i>important. I can't take the risk of being <i>too overwhelmed </i>by the difficulties of resisting my cigarette habit -- I <i>have </i>to take it easy. Otherwise, I might get desperate, and it might cause me to disregard those <i>things, </i>those <i>bigger </i>things, in my quest to rationalize my giving up and avoiding my own inconvenience. Quick! This is an emergency! Rather than fight tooth and nail, I must <i>compromise. </i>I must <i>compartmentalize </i>my cigarette habit, and must <i>never </i>approach it in the context of its relationship to bigger, more important things. Therefore, I <i>do not mind </i>my cigarette habit. Whew! That was close. <i>The end. </i><br>
<br></div><div>I had some strangers come up to me on the street like a week and a half ago. Two of them: a mom and her teenage son. They caught me as I walked aimlessly down some alley, beckoning welcomingly to me from a distance as though they already knew me, or as though we were family, and I immediately suspected from their style that they were Christians trying to evangelize to me. Now, my patience for the random person getting in my face isn't always particularly high, but I was in a pretty good mood at the time, I found their approach rather encouraging, and, as I am sometimes inclined to do with Christians, I also wanted to test and qualify them, so I engaged them.<br>
<br>we had an interesting encounter. Related on some mutual ground. They told me all kinds of affirming things about my entering into a new chapter of my life, which I interpreted as corroboration, and which I believed. Of particular relevance to this exchange, though, they offered to pray against my ailments. I tried to tell them, at first, that I was healthy, but they had seen me smoking a cigarette and continued to prod me about it. I was rather touched by our meeting, and I also, due to its content, attributed real significance to it, so I eventually budged and agreed that we could pray I recover from my cigarette habit. We did so. I specifically heard one of them cast out my spirit of addiction, and we were of one mind about it. We talked a little bit more. Then they <i>gave me money. </i>I walked around with the money in my pocket for a while, and I really wanted to give the no cigarettes thing a chance -- this, itself, was pretty astonishing to me. I didn't want to smoke cigarettes! But I eventually chose to act against my progress on purpose later in the day amidst my going absolutely batshit about this silly ex-wife of mine.<br>
<br></div><div>so, cut to present day. Not much more than a week later. I'm still in this good place. Along with my being in the good place, of course, is my having a lesser susceptibility to my acting according to my own conveniences. Well, more specifically, it's that <i>thing, </i>that thing where my convenience is just interpreted very differently. But hey, whatever. Either way, I care to quit smoking. I mean, I haven't <i>done </i>it, but still. I almost <i>never </i>care to quit smoking. I ignore it. I tell myself the story! But I care all of a sudden. And it's just crazy.<br>
<br></div><div>I only really first decided I would do it just yesterday. I prayed that I would do it. It got a good bit of attention in my prayers yesterday. But as a caveat, I even prayed that my doing it would occur as a gradual process in which I was reasonably comfortable throughout, in order that I would not be so inclined to discourage myself from doing it as to actually prevent myself from doing it. Why? Because I'm a weak bitch, pretty much. But oh well. I put some work in yesterday. I changed my mind today, but I already feel retarded that I haven't done more today, and it's not going away. I still care to do it. And it's still crazy.<br>
<br></div><div>I have no idea where this email came from. I started writing it this morning. My day is good. Blah blah blah.<br><br></div><div>talk soon.<br></div></div></div>

Then I had about an hour and a half until the party started, and it would have been really silly to drive home 30 minutes, be home 30 minutes, drive back to Lancaster for 30 minutes. And I was starving. So my sis and I went out to eat at a Vietnamese Restaurant. Drove in separate vehicles. That was her first time driving at night in the rain since her accident... so by the time we parked, I looked over and realized
she was crying and having a major anxiety attack. :-( &nbsp; &nbsp; So.. crawled out of my car into hers and hugging her and trying to calm her down. We then realized someone was in the car directly across from us and probably thought we were drug dealing or hooking up. HAH! Then we wiped off her mascara streaks and went in to eat. So freaking delicious. and that was when I had their coffee that was so intensely strong. I've never had something that strong before. It was so thick. It was like 6 cups of coffee in one. but anywho, she was significantly calmed down after we ate, and she made it home safely. So that's a plus.</div><div><br></div><div>I drove to the party from there. And sat out in my car for oh... 15-20 minutes because I didn't know exactly where the house was, and I was terrified to get out of my car at night in the city. Called a friend I knew
was going and let him know I was sitting in my little safety box like a chicken, and he very kindly agreed to notify me of when he arrived, and then walked me from my car to the party. At the same time I was trying to get a hold of people that were already there, but no such luck. Haha! Not only did my friend walk me there, he realized I was parked further away than necessary and hopped in my car with me and directed me around the block to a closer parking spot. So nice. and when it was time for me to leave, he walked out to his car to get something at the same time to make sure I got back into my car safely. I don't even know if he had to get something. He probably just told everybody that so they wouldn't get the idea he was coming on to me, or to make me think he wasn't walking out specially for me. because if he did say that, you know, that can send messages that he's interested in me or something. When really he's just a very caring, considerate
person. So nice. So very very nice.</div><div><br></div><div>The party was pretty alright. I did not drink because I knew I couldn't stay late. Which I ended up doing anyway.. xD &nbsp;But I was seriously jazzed up on coffee. Had 3 cups that morning. and then a Starbucks drink in the middle of the day because the chick that made me the hula hoop brought me a free one. She works at Starbucks. Win. And then of course I had that crazy strong Vietnamese coffee.</div><div><br></div><div>And then I continued to paint drunk friends! And one drunk stranger got pissy with me because I wouldn't let him take a turn painting. But hey, I get it, he's drunk, and he doesn't know me. He doesn't know I do it professionally, so he doesn't know how valuable my paints and brushes are
to me.</div><div><br></div><div>Got home very late... set an alarm to wake me up a 6:30 in the morning. I needed to be out the door for a gig yesterday by 9:00. So I thought 2.5 hours would be just about right for shower and breakfast and hair and makeup and getting my kit ready and all that shat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My alarm never woke me up. I woke up on my own at 8, freaking out. Looked at my alarms and both of them were set to go off on weekdays instead of Saturday. FFFFF! At the same time I was like "THANK YOU GOD! THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME WAKE UP AT 8 INSTEAD OF 10!"&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Never got the shower. Which I felt pretty ew about. Tied
back my oily hair and did the tiniest little touch-ups on the makeup from the night before that I was too lazy to wash off before bed. So the makeup part was kind of a win. Got my kit ready, bagel in hand, out the door. And I was still SO jazzed up on coffee from Friday, I had very high happy energy and had a great time face painting for this company's Easter party. They fed me yummy leftover muffins and fruit at the end too.</div><div><br></div><div>I was supposed to do a body painting project. The elephant with the chick I like working with. But it was so beautiful out that day, and I kinda got a feeling it wasn't the day for that project. So I sent her a text that gave her an open ticket to take a rain check if she wanted. Then got home, immediately had a crash from the coffee, took a nap, woke to a text from her saying she'd like to take a rain check
because her family wanted to spend time with her or something. So that played out well. :-) &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And I got to hang out with Philly man and his friend and her boyfriend. Although I'm kicking myself feeling like a total dork for half of everything that I did yesterday. I showered before I drove to Pottstown, and my hair air-dried in the wind as I was driving along. So failure #1: My hair was a frizzy poofball mess with curls positioned just right to make my face look fat. T_T &nbsp; &nbsp;And I was self conscious about having bad breath. and my blindingly white legs, and acne on my shoulders since I was wearing a sleeveless dress. And my overall awkward shy timidness that is so not me. With some overcompensating silliness in attempt to mask my nervousness. I am so tortured by anxiety.</div><div><br></div><div>But we all had funzies. his friend's boyfriend has a nasty black eye from Friday night. Apparently he got drunk and got his ass and his car whooped. So he was holding up a giant ice pack to his face just about all day. Poor thing. He also doesn't speak english super well, so he's only in on half of what's going on. And we dragged him all over the place yesterday.</div><div><br></div><div>The highlight was playing at a crazy children's playground. funky ass swings and teeter totter contraptions and spinning contraptions and tube slides that looked liked the friggin giant water slides at hershey park.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally watched Frozen too. Now
I know what all the little kiddies are going crazy over when I am at birthday parties and such.</div><div><br></div><div>My contacts were so dry on the way home. all the lights were trippled in size on the way home. It was very difficult to see. I probably would have been better off taking them out before driving. an hour of straining to see. and I got home and passed the fuck out. What a damn fun Saturday overall though, i would say.</div><div><br></div><div>Gonna spend to with my sister and a friend of ours at the par today. They are on their way over. I need to eat and have coffee ready before they get here. hope you're enjoying the weather too. ciao!</div></div></div></div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Apr 13, 2014 at 1:01 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;Ï†3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>park. at the park. xD</span></div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Apr 13, 2014 at 1:03 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;Ï†3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>Holy shit I make a lot of typos.

vision with my brother for the first time last night. He was struggling
with a fear he was experiencing as a direct result of the drugs he had
done throughout the evening, and I know a correct perception of the
Lord's loving character confers with it an understanding that those
under his care will be protected and shepherded rightly, so, though I do
not remember the circumstances specifically, I can only assume I
mentioned the vision with the intention of demonstrating that character
by its immediate role unto my person, hoping my brother would not be
scared. I explained my experience to him as best I could.<br><br>my
brother understood, and it was good, but, partially due to the effects
of the drugs, our talk soon degenerated into squabbling about
meaningless things. He was envious of my progress, you see, and he
resented my ability to implicate him. I found myself unable to
communicate to him. We mutually abandoned our conversation, unable to
proceed, and, in consideration of his position, I prayed that he
received something himself in order that he would feel included --
perhaps not a <i>vision, </i>I specified, but <i>something. </i>I went to sleep and left him to suffer his drug-induced restlessness alone.<br><br></div>this
morning, he slept until noon. I had already planned to take time for
myself rather than follow him to church today, were he to have attended
church at all, but I managed to enjoy a quiet morning regardless, which I
mostly spent reading over our old emails. He eventually awoke, and we
proceeded to speak kindly to one another. He expressed some of his
concerns to me, about his drugs, about his behavior, and so on, and I
very delicately expressed some of mine. We approached all of these
things in the context of their function and value to a relationship with
the Lord. We each agreed that our interaction was very healthy and
useful, and was worthy to be considered church fellowship.<br><br></div>he
mentioned offhandedly, at some point, that he had some weird dream last
night. I know he sometimes just likes to tell me about his business, so
I invited him to share and I listened. He proceeded to describe a town,
in his dream, that was being oppressed by its mayor. Most nobody in the
town liked the mayor, but the mayor was allowed to continue governing
by the authority of his superiors. My brother, a citizen of the town,
watched as the mayor climbed something reminiscent of a telephone pole,
unplugged a router that was kept at the top, and proceeded to taunt the
town's inhabitants about how he had just disabled their internet access.
My brother, outraged, threateningly took out his phone and sought to
contact the mayor's superiors directly. His call connected, but before
he heard a reply, he woke up.<br><br></div>I was cheesing <i>way </i>before
he was done telling me this story, of course. Couldn't stop smiling.
The second he was done, I offered to tell him what it meant. He
accepted. I'm <i>surprised </i>he accepted: I was unnecessarily haughty about it. But he did. I told him <i>he </i>was the town. The mayor was <i>drugs, </i>who
had been given permission to wreak havoc on the town. The mayor's
superior was God. The unplugging of the router was the disabled
connection between the inhabitants of the town, all of whom hated the
mayor, and was simultaneously my brother's disabled connection with God
through those same channels. My brother picked up his phone and called
the superior directly, but it took the severing of the internet
connection to make him do it. He woke up before he heard the reply, and
the reply only came after he woke up, I said -- from <i>outside </i>the
dream. Hint hint. I kept cheesing and watched as my brother digested
what I had told him, enjoying his appreciation immensely. I later
learned that, while I slept the evening before, he, himself, had prayed
nearly exactly what I also prayed for him.<br><br></div>I met Galina on
the internet nearly ten years ago. We spoke for some months before I
finally ended up seeing her in real life. I remember that, almost
immediately prior to my flying myself to Florida and first meeting up
with her, I was very anxious that I would somehow disappoint her, and,
hoping to soften the imaginary blow, I specifically warned her about
some minimal and inconsequential acne I had on my shoulders at the time.
It should be noted, though, that I also nudged her into sending me
topless pictures of herself in her own process of qualifying herself to
me. I also concealed an <i>outrageous </i>amount of invented backstory
with which I had previously decorated my identity, only just at that
time starting to mature in such a way that I would eventually have the
strength to abandon it. Holy <i>crap </i>I have changed.<br><br>we finally met, though, and, <i>instantly, </i>she was <i>all over </i>me. <i>Immediately </i>kissing me the <i>second </i>my face was unobstructed by the separated seats of our taxi. Rushing to <i>blow </i>me the <i>very </i>moment we even entered my hotel room. But I resisted her! I resisted her the <i>entire time </i>I was there. I didn't even let her finish her <i>blowjob </i>until shortly before I went home, <i>months later, </i>when I visited her <i>again. </i>That's who you're talking to, buddy, friend. He is not fucking around.<br>

Of course. And I will. I <i>definitely </i>will.<br><br>I was trying to&nbsp;<i>give&nbsp;</i>you something, silly. So&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>could have it. I was offering to <i>sacrifice&nbsp;</i>my doing it myself.<br>
<br>either way, I'm going to be busy this week. I'm going to be quite busy, getting irreconcilably irritable and proceeding to deal with it. You probably won't hear from me very much, if at all. I will likely even refrain from checking my emails entirely, and, in part, so as not to risk using them as some silly justification for being irrationally pissed off.<br>
<br>please know: I am not at all disappearing because I'm trying to starve you out like a tapeworm. I have already long recognized the futility of such an approach, and I would feel much too guilty doing that to you, even if it worked. Rather, it is because, from what my experiences have shown, my having the available opportunity of&nbsp;<i>appealing&nbsp;</i>to you, such as I would by allowing myself to vent my difficulties to you, may increase the likelihood I am sufficiently satisfied by your approval alone, and will put me at greater risk of lowering my own standards. I know these risks. I know what I need to do to deal with them.<br>
<br>I will reappear before the week is over, I'm sure. It's really only those first couple of days that are even difficult. Until then, though, should you happen to feel lonely in your boring little <i>email box, </i>you should really check out some of the old messages I've sent you throughout these couple of months we've been talking. I was just looking them over this morning. They are <i>treasure. </i>Particularly, they are treasure when viewed in light of what you have only come to learn better by speaking to me much more and over a longer span of time. They are a whole new set of emails. They are Easter eggs out the <i>ass. </i>And should you feel so inclined, or should you even feel so inclined as to do me a <i>favor, </i>you should read them. You will like them a lot.<br>
<br>I'm thinking: don't you <i>dare </i>tell <i>me </i>what a negotiation is! I <i>know </i>what a negotiation is. I <i>know.&nbsp;</i><br><br>I'm thinking: I definitely do not hate you at all.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
