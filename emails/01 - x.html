That's how much you interest me AND freak me out. Now that's some sick commitment. The day I stumbled on your profile was a very strange day. And i was on alert that morning to look out for what happened to me that day. So I think I stumbled into you for a reason. Definitely for the hope of understanding you better. Because maybe it'll help me accept things from the past. And hopefully give me helpful insight into the future. </p>

<p>I feel very silly that you're here meeting x number of people while planning to casually date z more people, yet I am on some indeterminate probationary period where anything beyond an email is too risky to consider. I'm telling myself that perhaps there is more to the picture than I understand, and that it is good. But I don't know. Meanwhile, it's before 7am and I am rushing to read my emails. Rush rush rush. Guh. Please don't hurt me.</p>
<p>I subject myself to so much generalization by being honest. Sooo much. Nobody cares whether they are offending a psychopath, either. They will sanitize themselves for a gay person, for a woman, for a religious person, but they will generalize absolutely anything about a psychopath. And it is so silly -- I would swear it remains zero times total that a motherfucker has had even the slightest clue what he is talking about. Zero. Either I tell them, or they don't know aaannyything. But that is what I deal with when I tell the truth. And ugh. And probation. And poke poke poke.</p>

There were all kinds of weird and assorted trinkets down there; I don't know what any of it is. But yeah. One time as I was wandering off to find something like a bathroom, I decided to pee in a couple of the trays and leave them in some conspicuous location, because it makes me laugh to imagine someone eventually finding them like that. This is among some of the most antisocial shit I let myself do or care to do these days.<br>

&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr><div><div><div><div><div>why do I freak you out so much, anyway, I wonder? There is so much I don't know. Is it because you fear an unrestrained person? Is it because you believe a person will necessarily do evil, and that it is good for a person to be inhibited -- be it by social constraints or psychological ones or what have you? I am just guessing; I don't know the answer. <br>
<br>I, myself, though, do believe the things I have proposed. I am sure people are evil. All of them. I am sure that the things which cause them to behave in morally acceptable ways are simply circumstantial things, done in response to the perceived advantage of being a moral person, and that, should it seem more advantageous to act without moral consideration, they will simply act alternatively to a moral person instead.<br>
<br>I <i>know </i>this is true, too. I know because this is the difference between myself and the regular person: I am able to calculate the route, the pathway from event to event, through which unconscionable behavior is able to be experienced as reward, rather than as inconvenience. I am able to maneuver around such things as an investment in x, y, z outcome, or a concern with conforming to a, b, c ideal conceptualization of myself..... none of those elements need factor into how advantageous my circumstances are, as I am able to value and devalue those elements however I wish. Meanwhile, I can reach into the invisible..... I can say something like..... it is <i>good </i>that I am violating my own sensibilities! It is good that I am acting <i>contrary </i>to what previously were my <i>own </i>preferences! Because.... blah blah blah corroboratory line of reasoning. Also, also, also....! Blah blah blah contradictory reasoning...... is <i>meaningless! </i><br>
<br></div>yes, I can do that. With ease, I can do it. Psychopathy is consciousness. And that is why I agree an unrestrained person is dangerous. But I also agree that there is some good to be derived from consciousness. For instance, enabled by consciousness is <i>conscientiousness. </i>That is: by my awareness, I am made more able to be conscientious toward a person. I am made more observant of what will benefit a person, and I am made more able to discern what things may potentially wrong a person as I am doing them, so as to keep myself from doing them. This ability is enormously valuable.<br>
<br>granted, though: just because I have the <i>capacity </i>to observe these things, it does not mean that I will actually observe them. It's a fine line. I need a <i>reason </i>to observe them; I need a reason to care to seek them out. Clearly, human evil is not a sufficient reason. That is, the inherent human desire I speak of, the desire to advantage oneself, is not a sufficient reason; it will not facilitate any more conscientious behavior. Which is exactly why an unrestrained person is dangerous; why he is dangerous when he is further enabled by his greater measure of consciousness. Why a psychopath is dangerous. We agree.<br>
<br></div>my thing is that..... I have all this understanding. I know how all of this stuff works.... I know a <i>lot. </i>I know what the most crucial ingredients are to this puzzle. Among them is the sufficient reason to deny oneself and act in the interest of others instead -- in order that conscientious behavior, and a conscientious mind, may be enabled to exist. Surely, this is a central ingredient. And surely, under such conditions, unrestrained consciousness will not be a liability, and will not be dangerous. So, y'know. That's what I'm about. That's why honesty is important to me. Compromise my ability to do evil. That's why love is important to me. Makes me desire genuinely to do good. Makes it advantageous to overlook what is singularly important to me. I don't know.<br>
<br></div>I'm getting to the point where I've been typing for so long that the enthusiasm responsible for my manic and elaborate outbursts is starting to degrade into confusion and total unfamiliarity with whatever I was even fucking talking about. It's cool, though, as I typed this on my laptop and I'm glad I got to bring some of these things up. Have not addressed any of this subject matter for quite a long time..... good to know it isn't lost forever to homelessness and age. Blah blah blah.<br>
<br></div>dog shit &amp; chocolate. They rhyme. Sort of? They rhyme.<br><br></div>eheheh.<br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Fri, Jan 10, 2014 at 12:14 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div>Good morning Mike. What did you have for breakfast?</div><div><br></div><div>My jaw dropped at how fucked up it is to leave trays of piss on the top of a door. It's hilarious how messed up it is.&nbsp;</div><div>What if someone is distracted and doesn't notice them, goes to shut a door and the trays crash down and splash urine everywhere? Talk about a bad day. And along with that point, I'm thinking, when I see comedy movies where things like that happen to "the bad guy," it's enjoyable to watch. Like the movie Home Alone. The entire movie is a little kid setting up traps for the robbers, and then watching them endure all of it trying to get to him. So it somehow justifies treating them that way in our minds, because we feel they deserve it. If you think everybody has evil in them, is that
what would justify setting them up like that? Is that what brings the humor into the idea of someone stumbling into that? I mean, I'm sure the trays are very noticeable, and probably won't fall. But still, someone has to clean that up, yeah? Talk about inconvenient. Though in another way, it does probably make their life more amusing and interesting. Kind of like how you found the chocolate sitting on top of the dog poo. It definitely made your day more interesting because it was so bizarre. So you could argue that you are enriching someone else's life with the pee trays, because that is not something they would expect to encounter. And it's a story to tell, just like you had to share the chocolate dog poo with me, and others I'm sure. You're never going to forget that chocolate dog poo pile.</div><div><br></div><div>Welp, my account is disabled thank goodness. My brain was losing some functioning capabilities. Man-message overload.</div><div>It's a
compliment to your intelligence, your capability, and your uniqueness that I am afraid to trust you and made an account entirely for the purpose of talking to you without you knowing my full name and phone number, isn't it? I could easily cut off all the other people on OkCupid whom I do not trust, because they don't interest me to know. Likewise I must not think the guys I go on dates with would be able to outsmart me to get what they want of me should they have hidden intentions. I feel that I'd catch wind of hidden intentions, and I'd stand my ground and keep to a safe position. I don't fear their next moves. They are more predictable than you would be. I don't trust them, but I trust their nature is easier to count on for predictability. Sure, maybe one of them along the line might surprise me. I'm aware I'm surprisable. And I know some people still play games with me that I don't see. But I at least have a false sense of semi-security to allow me
to have some kind of interaction with men. God I wish I were a lesbian sometimes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Why do you freak me out? That would be correct to say it is in part because I fear an unrestrained person. There are no rules when you are unrestrained by conscience and empathy. I fear finding myself in a position again where someone fools me and takes advantage of me by recognizing that I live by empathy. I am a toy, an object, a pawn to people who see my empathy and my large capacity for guilt as weaknesses.</div><div><br></div><div>You think all people are evil? See, I used to think all people were good. Because I think of myself as being good, so I projected my own moral compass out onto everyone else. I thought everybody felt empathy, care, love, like I did. And that people who hurt others were just "troubled" and needed understanding and love to turn themselves around. But that's not really true is it? It's a game to them, and it's
about winning, being on top, not being weak, taking what they want. I wonder if conscience is determined by the brain or by the soul. I wonder if some people are demons in human bodies while others are angels. Evil does not understand good, and good does not understand evil.</div><div><br></div><div>I am a good person. I do things morally acceptable because it fills me with joy to bring another joy. When another person feels pain, I feel their pain deeper than if it were my own sometimes. I wish that I could take the bad things that happened to them, and have them happen to me instead. I hate to see others suffer. It fills me with immense joy to bring others joy. It repulses or discourages or saddens me when I see extreme selfishness or thoughtlessness towards the feelings of others. I don't think I have evil in me. Certainly ignorance at times.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I do not agree with many social norms. I do not fit in with most people. I do
not understand what compels people to want to be so influenced by their peers. I did cyber school my last two years of high school, because I felt no ties to my peers. I was done with it. I've never liked church. I've never liked "club" type events. I feel like it's all so fake and shallow and it gives me the heeby jeebies that run under my skin. I like talking with people one on one. I am not myself in large groups where there are expectations of me to try and conform. I don't like being in the attention of many. On my birthday, I'm a hermit. I'm a nervous wreck when I have too much attention from so many people all at once. I don't feel comfortable around a lot of people. I loath when I have to go to the store, because there are people at the store. And being around all those people is awkward. I don't like to social norms and barriers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So you say psychopathy is consciousness. That expansion in consciousness and
awareness is made possible by impairment or lack of conscientiousness. You may be more aware of what would benefit a person or wrong a person. But it is far more likely that since that lack of conscientiousness that made you aware in the first place will lead you to act on whichever most benefits you. If benefiting them benefits you, you'll probably do it. If wronging them benefits you, you'll probably do it. Psychopathy definitely makes a person more analytical and better able to see what all of their consequences would be for any given action, with less concern for the consequences of others, and thus is a fantastic mechanism for self preservation, self indulgence, and ultimately survival. In a dog eat dog world, that definitely makes someone bigger, better, faster, stronger, smarter.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm glad you're honest. But you're also capable of being dishonest, and being very believable while you're at it. So when are others to know
when you are compromising evil, and when you are not? When are you being led by love, and when do you decide that you'd rather fuck with people?</div><div><br></div><div>I hope I don't come off offensive. I might just come off that way. But I think you're probably aware that I come off offensive because I am not fully aware of who you are. I'm questioning you. Maybe even cynically, because I hold bitterness towards people I've met that share a handful of your characteristics with you. But yet I'm being completely open and honest with you, as I would not be with them, because I know you hear me. Because I know you're being honest. You are welcome to be as brutally honest and cynical on my take as I am of yours. I know it's very possible that I am blinded by emotion in more ways than I already recognize. I appreciate my discussions with you.</div><div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">You may find this funny.

My friend and I -- Justin and I -- have been alternating between sleeping in this abandoned basement and sleeping at the shelter aforementioned. I don't like the shelter for whatever reason. I have to check in early, which sucks. Like before 9pm so the beds don't fill up early. And once I check in early, I'm not allowed to go back outside without being locked out, even just for a cigarette. (Cigarettes are bad. Never smoke them.) Plus I am surrounded by homeless people, pandemonium, etc.. I like the basement better. But we haven't been back to the basement since hearing those footsteps or whatever. <br>

Instead, despite my opting to sleep in this basement, I went to bed very early and slept for a nearly 12 hours, which I hate. My ideal rest period is maybe six hours or fewer -- I really love when I am able to awaken after like a three or four hour span, actually, while not disrupting my REM cycle and managing to feel sufficiently rested. I wish I could set an alarm for that sort of thing, but I don't think it is possible to coordinate it correctly with my body's clock.<br>
<br></div>on the subject, I had my phone stripped away from me in some freak accident midday yesterday. I was minding my own business, just walking, when suddenly, by no apparent cause, the phone flew some six forceful yards backward out of my pocket and snapped its case open on the ground behind me. Since then, its screen has completely failed to respond to touch input, and the phone is unusable in any capacity except as a pocket clock -- including as an alarm clock, since I am not able to browse through its applications' menus or anything of the sort. Part of me wants to view the event as a sort of purposeful manilla envelope addressed specifically to me, as if from God, or the universe, or whatever most unoffensive and neutral terminology would aptly describe a supernatural prankster who intentionally breaks my phone. Why? I don't know why. Because I deserve it, probably. Because it dealt so precise a blow to my comfort I cannot help but suspect awareness and agency are present. I don't know. I'm only being partially serious here, btw. I kinda go both ways at one time.<br>
<br></div>surrounded by people trying to rush around and do meaningless things. Kinda getting sick of Justin and his ADD symptoms trying to keep himself busy by every imaginable avenue while delaying his turning himself in for his warrants..... looking more forward to just being peaceful and bored on the street by myself.

In my case, I mean. I don't like leaving myself as the agent who makes value judgments like that. But you were very much on point with the comparison between the amusing chocolate I found on the sidewalk and the pee trays someone will eventually discover. I dunno. I definitely do have a part of me that can find amusement in shitting on peoples' days, but I suppress it. I have a higher faculty that doesn't want to wrong anyone, so I roll with that instead. But I do sort of channel the urge into doing more general sorts of disruptive things, if I am going to exercise it at all. Things that ideally don't do any damage, but that disrupt a person's expectations. To show them something outside their ordinary experience. That's what makes it funny. I mean, the chocolate is an example: it's funny when it happens to me! And I like it. So that's why I like to do it. I just think it's cool to broaden the field a little bit.<br>
<br>I honestly.... I love presenting the weird, or the different, or the seemingly undesirable in such a way that it is successfully accepted as good and received willingly by another person. To me, violating boundaries -- and carefully, in such a way that the boundaries are intentionally allowed to change -- is an art. And I love, love, love doing it. Making some uncomfortable shit look appealing, demonstrating that such-and-such is safe, whatever. I feel like I am escorting new dimensions of peoples' selves into existence. And it's word.

<p>since last mailing you, I again had my phone unexplainably yanked from my pocket and smashed on the ground. Now, after picking it back up, it works. I don't even understand -- I tried resetting the thing and replacing the battery manually, many times, only to accomplish nothing. Suddenly, another freak accident, and presto. Working phone.</p>
<p>I am only more suspicious still that this series of events was intended as some sort of inside joke, specifically for me, upon seeing it further unfold, by the way. Well, maybe it's for you, too, actually. Combo multiplier. Here, have some.</p>
<p>do you ever play video games, or did you ever? Do you like dogs, cats, both, neither? Send me a song you like or something. Show off. Show off your taste. Tell me something about your home schooling.</p>
<p>when I was sixteen, I threw a giant metal train wheel off a highway overpass into the front window of a passing 18-wheeler. The cab of the truck was more or less totally destroyed and there were maybe four other vehicles affected in minimal ways as the truck was recovering. I was locked up for some time -- over a year total, spread across one place I was committed to initially, and a second I went to after running away from the first. I distinctly remember the judge who sentenced me having said some shit about.... my charges being "the most sociopathic" he'd ever seen. I didn't even have much appreciation for what it meant at the time. A part of me can look back and laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the events, but these days, I mostly just view them with utter gratitude that nobody was injured or killed. I underwent a lot of psychological growth during that one-year vacation or whatever.... that behavior was some of the last of its kind.</p>

Woke up to a bad dream and here I am a little while later. I'll be off to bed again maybe in another hour.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am the queen of sleep. 12 hours is not that rare for me. Depends on life phases and depression and things like that. For a year, I basically needed 11 hours of sleep to function. Now I'm back to 7 to 9 hours for the most part. When I get depressed or anxious, I sleep more. My record is 17 hours, and I was just in complete emotional despair that day. Haha. Sleep is my form of
escapism. I've never had trouble falling asleep. Doesn't matter how much caffeigne I have, or how many thoughts are racing through my mind. When I want to sleep, I sleep.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That's interesting what happened with your phone. I definitely would also be one to think that it's the universe/God. To remind you to appreciate what you have, because you never know what something means to you until it's taken away. Which I'm sure you're already beyond aware of in your situation. Or maybe it was just to be like "Hey remember buddy, I'm the one in control."</div><div><br></div><div>I think it's cool to leave things in a way for someone to find them that surprises them. :-)</div><div><br></div><div>I never play video games. Back in the day, I would play DDR with a friend. Or I would play tetris or frogger or pacman on my computer. That is the extent of my gaming. Which is basically none. Most video games I could care less about, and I get
annoyed when I get stuck sitting around watching someone *coughpastboyfriendscough* play them. Unless I happen to be in an apathetic mood to begin with.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love cats and dogs. Especially cats, but I am an all around animal lover. and Snakes. Snakes are fricken cool. I almost wish I still had snakes. My room was a zoo as a kid. Now I don't like the idea of caged pets. I think it's fucked up to have animals kept in cages and completely dependent on a person for their health and survival and happiness. The thought of how many animals get horribly neglected disturbs me. What a sad, sad life for so many little critters.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you really care to know my taste in music? Haha! I will dig some up for next message I send you if you really wish. I'm not one to show off. I like my taste and that's what matters. I don't expect the world to like my taste as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I got one suspension
in the duration of my schooling, in elementary school, for missing THAT much homework. Then suddenly after that it clicked. I buried my nose in schoolwork and did all my homework from then on, and got straight A's all the way through school. Up until my 11th grade year, my first year of cyber school. That year I bombed everything simply by procrastinating, and then scrambling and failing to get it all done in the last week of a marking period before a deadline. 12th grade, I still procrastinated a great deal, but still found a way to get all straight As again. So cyber school taught me how to cram, how to prioritize tasks by level of importance, and how to let go of perfectionism in order to get things done. That's really my problem that holds me back a lot of the time. Perfection is intimidating to try to achieve, and is easy to stall on. Sometimes not caring as much, or letting go of some care, is very healthy.</div><div><br></div><div>Just like
perfection. Empathy. I've learned I have to let go of it in some situations. I have to block it sometimes, or else I will exhaust my resources trying to care for people who are just using me.</div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div>In my ideal world, I would have endless time to dedicate to perfect projects, and I would be surrounded by nothing but good people, all worthy of my care so I wouldn't have to question their motives.</div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R

<p>I, too, am a professional at sleeping, despite our using our aptitudes differently. Like you, I am able to drift off to sleep in virtually any circumstance, be it a bright place, a noisy place.... a bright place, outdoors, made of cement and brick, while caffeinated, while surrounded by hectic vehicle and foot traffic alike.... or what have you. Neither do active thoughts keep me awake: apparently, I'm kinda weird for this, but my preferred means of passing myself out is simply to think and imagine vividly, which tends to transition me seamlessly into a dream state in very little time.</p>
<p>as an added bonus, I also retain a sort of compartmentalized lucidity, even as I sleep. I am able to determine the relevance of things around me and awaken selectively when I am sleeping. So I can do things like.... sleep through a party, but wake up to respond to a conversation about my topic of choice at the party. It's pretty sweet, though I'm sure it's not particularly unique -- many people are known to respond to the calling of their names, for example. I was known for waking up just in time for the passing of a lit blunt in my day, personally, but I digress (drugs are bad. Never do them).</p>
<p>I've had many instances where I would be sleeping or dreaming obliviously only to be interfered with by what I understand as subtle but nefarious spiritual agency -- or, more specifically, demons, who are able to utilize the altered state of consciousness brought about by hypnagogia and dreams to more comprehensively affect a person's experience. I don't know if you have any familiarity with such things, but I do. In any case, in such instances, my compartmentalized lucidity will activate, noticing something is amiss, and the experiences will subsequently be terminated by my conscious avoidance. I consider this to be, by far, the most useful and noteworthy functionality of the ability.</p>
<p>I appreciate your revealing to me your variance in moods, your episodes, your.... sleeping heavily in the case that you are depressed, whatever. Not like I would fault you or judge you by such things.... but I am pleased that you are open to volunteering information to me. I get anxious too, y'know. Sometimes. When I'm expecting to do something, I do. Irrationally. And mumble mumble mumble.</p>
<p>similarly, I don't care about your taste in music, or your video games, or your choice between animals, in such a way that it matters, or in such a way that you are subject to contradicting my preferences. I just ask because these things are yours -- I appreciate them and want to see them because they are yours. I like that you share them. And I like that I am able to.... accept them, encourage them, something. All of that, I like. But so complicated....!</p>
<p>no video games, though? Boooo. Not really. But boooo. To be fair, I'm not one of these kids who will sit around playing Call of Duty all day or whatever: I haven't had an active gaming habit for some years, and that whole online multiplayer crap was never my scene anyway. I hate newer generations of games and present-day gamer culture. But I did grow up with video games -- I am older than Nintendo consoles! I was playing the original Super Mario Bros. at three years old while my parents gawked and wondered how the fuck I was doing it n' shit. And I have much fond nostalgia and enthusiasm for video games. Granted, it doesn't matter. But I do.</p>
<p>I remember being part of some experiment in early grade school where the faculties of the kids who grew up playing video games were tested against those of the kids who didn't play any. We were split into separate groups based on our habits and given a variety of tasks to measure our reflexes, our attention spans, and so on. Of particular note, the players of video games scored something like three times higher than the others, unanimously, by every measure. So, boooo. Boooo you. ;)</p>
<p>on the subject, though, I am grateful for your comprehension. I know that you are not slow, and that there is understanding between us, and that is about as far as I will ever care to index the matter in my mind, beyond for the purpose of simply appreciating to a greater extent. I am glad that you appreciate my head, also, as I can see that you do. I say these things just to clarify our dealings need never be any more compensatory than they are -- that things are pretty freakin' swell right where they're at, actually. And thank you so much for reading by lengthy and convoluted sentences, holy fuck. My periphrastic and circumlocutory sentences. My prolixity. My babble babble babble into a puddle. Thank you.</p>
<p>I am convinced the altered consciousness of dreams and hypnagogic states, by which humans are made more privy to the stimuli of the spiritual, is explicitly, deliberately related to the greater attention spans allowed to those like myself who have grown up with video games. Just the same, I am convinced many conventions of the modern world -- like Facebook and Reddit, which incite their respective users to a consciousness of how they are perceived by their peers, for example, simply by casual use of the websites -- are also likewise contributing to this same broadening of experience, and to the same end. I believe psychopathy is hugely significant -- not just on a small scale, but to the world -- due especially to its relationship to this consciousness. I believe such radical things.... things nobody else has ever approached. I knoww thingssss. I do. And when it makes sense, I will be so happy to tell you all of them.</p>
<p>I don't believe in a person who is worthy of my care. I mean, people are cool n' shit; I don't give myself reasons to deny them. I try not to. But I don't believe in being good to people on the basis of what they are, or what they are to me, or what I think they are. To me, it's just.... either I contribute more good to the situation, or I don't. Either I want more good to exist, or I don't. Doesn't matter if it "belongs" there, doesn't matter if it's "fair," doesn't matter if it is deserved. I feel like those are the types of things I would worry myself about if I were already looking for a reason to do little, or do less. I feel like it is more productive to just do things if it is possible to do them, and just do them so they get done. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I've been super smart since I was young. School was always very easy throughout, but eventually I just started failing everything on the basis of my not doing any work. I failed every single semester of every single class from the point of first entering middle school and onward just for not doing any work. My thinking was pretty much: why the fuck should I have to do any work? I eventually got my GED, though, when I was locked up as a juvenile -- that is, when I threw the train wheel. It was easy. I would swear I saw kids who couldn't even read pass the test.</p>
<p>you are an awesome pen pal. I can say many more things, but perhaps I will save them for future skyscrapers of letters: I have something like a real life I am juggling. Trying to. Eheheh.</p>
<p>I like your pictures btw. But they make your pictures folder kind of weird and disorganized :(</p>
<p>pz.</p>

Makes me sad and sick to my stomach when I think how helpless people can be when they're addicted to heroin or any of that heavy stuff. :-( &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have had experiences in my sleep in which I felt like I was fighting some kind of dark force. Where I actually try to wake myself, and in the in between stage, I'm wrestling with something invisible pressing down from on top of me. Fighting to hold my eyelids open, fighting to lift my arms or legs to push it away, to sit up. For what seems like forever. It really feels like someone on top of me restraining me. But you could always say that's just my brain coming to before my muscles are allowed out of the sleep state. Needless to say, it's scary. I've only had that happen
twice.</div><div><br></div><div>I also can't listen to noisemakers. I've been given them to use before to block out scary noises outside, or someone having sex in the next room. But I always always always end up hearing voices in the noisemaker. Also scary as shit.</div><div><br></div><div>I've been having awful nightmares. And if not nightmares, just straight up unpleasant dreams. Me no likes. Most of the time though, when a nightmare happens, I can recognize I'm dreaming, and either slightly alter what's happening, or force myself to wake up before the most climactic moment happens. It's funny when I can take control in a scary dream, because I take control, but I can't just erase whatever scary thing is after me. My brain isn't totally able to switch away from that plot, I have to roll with it if I stay asleep. Like I may realize "Ooh, I'm dreaming so I can move things around and shape shift. And I can just let them stab me right now, and I won't
feel it because this isn't real." But I'm not able to just got from crazy person chasing me with a knife to being in a field full of daisies and bunnies. Which is sad.</div><div><br></div><div>Flying dreams are my favorite. Do you have flying dreams? There's like a feeling of intense energy running through my body. It feels amazing. It's my favorite feeling in the world. I'd like to think, when not on planet earth, that's what I'll feel all the time.</div><div><br></div><div>I also have shapeshifting dreams, and throughout the dream, it seems perfectly normal for myself and others to not be in their normal human forms, or to start out that way, and then be someone or something different every passing "scene" of the dream. Like going from a person to a catfish to a yetti. Or from myself to a little boy. Or sometimes, we're all just birds through the entire dream. And animals in reality, like the old cat from work, visits me and is personified and talks
with me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ooh, what other things can I tell you? I have a history of anxiety and depression. It runs in the family. But hey, who doesn't have anxiety and depression?</div><div><br></div><div>Fact: I end up crying every time I go to the doctor's office. I'm fine until the nurse gets me back in the room and starts asking me personal questions while she looks at my health history. When under the spotlight, I totally crack. Haha! Every time I go, they try to prescribe antidepressants. But I'm terrified of taking antidepressants. I was prescribed them once 4 years ago back when I lived in another town. I picked them up from the pharmacy, got home, sat and cried while staring at the pharmacy bag, never took any. Held on to it for 3 years. Just threw it out last year. And every doctor visit since, when my new lady doctor suggests it, I just explain how even if I really try to follow through with it, they just scare the shit out of
me and that I would probably just pick them up and then chicken out. So she told me to get fish oil pills. and take vitamins. and exercise. and eat healthy. I can do that. She says to see a counselor as well, which I used to. Too expensive to keep up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I get anxious so easily. I get anxious when I have to tell a group of jerk kids who never listen to stop playing in our driveway. Like tight chest and lump in my throat kind of anxiety. Or when anybody comes to our door, just about, unless I'm expecting pizza or chinese food. I'm a mess. I make up excuses not to go for walks or jogs by myself because I'm afraid of people watching me. I worry about what people in our neighborhood think of me. There's that fake, shallow friendliness. idk. I feel like living in the country far away from other houses, or living in the city would be better. That's when people care less about watching you. Suburbanites are all about getting up in
each other's business. Buhh, heeby jeebies.</div><div><br></div><div>My taste in music.</div><div>I used to listen to nothing but Mindless Self Indulgence. I used to listen to nothing but the Cranberries. I used to listen to nothing but Bright Eyes. I used to listen to nothing but the Dresdon Dolls. I go through phases for sure, in which I listen to one band over and over, or one song over and over. If it gives me a powerful emotional response, I cling onto it for as long as it causes that. Right now it's the song Youth by Daughter, which is mediocre at best. If you were to listen to it, you'd probably roll your eyes and shut it off in 15 seconds to avoid your head bursting from thinking about how crap it is. Meanwhile thinking how lame my taste in music is.</div><div>I like quirky obnoxious girly shit. Like Rasputina and Cocorosie and Metric to MIA and Santigold. I like cheesy trancy dubsteppish music like this:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeaIvjoH1FY" target=_blank>http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=ZeaIvjoH1FY</a></div><div>For my current phase, I keep the TV on a channel that plays all folk rock. And when I'm in the car, I've been in a radio phase, where I surf that until I stumble into an old 80's song I like.&nbsp;</div><div>Your turn.</div><div><br></div><div>You know what, Mario is cute. Some games are cute. I hate the life-like-iss shooting war or zombie games. Hate hate hate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have to be selective with who and what I care about. Otherwise, I'd be a bigger ball of depression than what I am now. I am prone to giving too much and draining myself for others. I am people-pleaser by nature. Somewhere I have to put the breaks on before I hurt myself. And so I am left to figure out who is worthy of it, and who to deny. Otherwise, the energy vampires will close in on me and suck me dry. It's not a matter of giving less, but figuring out where to channel my devotion to being caring. In a way
that giving positive energy creates more positive energy, so that the giving of positive energy can continuously flow. Does this make sense?</div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div>I have a picture folder huh?&nbsp;</div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Jan 12, 2014 at 8:36 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>I've been feeling very emotionally drained this past week.

<br>I like that you don't take antidepressants. Modern medicine has all kind of explanation for all kinds of shit, but there's a lot to be said about the malleability of one's own psychology, and there's a lot to be said about the possibilities you remove from the equation upon assuming an issue is sufficiently explained, and that its solution is known. Consider this a general response to everything you have said thus far about your head: I can tell you sooo manyyy things. Your anxiety over how you are perceived -- ha! You are so due for an awakening. A liberation! A real one. You have no idea. But goodness I have so many things to tell you.<br>
<br>you kiiinda have a pictures folder. I started making the comments well before I saved any pictures, as a joke (creeper jokes are kinda just my shit). Since then, I have saved your pictures. You're pretty. I will never say anything in disapproval of your looks in my life. I don't jerk off to them or anything -- I'm too busy writing novels and pining over emails to jerk off. And I can't say I've even dedicated a folder to them -- it's too much work on a phone. However, I did save them. And maybe I looked at them a little. And that's it. Why? Do you want one? ;)<br>
<br>why do you spend all day hitting her up on your phone when she won't even meet you, Justin asks. Why do you keep sitting here writing emails for an hour at a time? Ha ha ha ha, I tell him. Ha ha ha ha.<br><br>might be back in a little....?<br>

It's not even that tiring of a job. I know it's because my body is just not used to it after so long of not doing that job. So I get wiped out pretty quickly doing that heavy lifting work.

If there's a 1% chance that something could happen or has happened that would wreck my world, I worry my ass off as if my world is about to be wrecked. It's a shame I have to take a pregnancy test to stop the madness going on in my brain. But I fear if I don't, I would let the very irrational thought take over.

I think I'm more self conscious than the typical person though. I take these things too seriously. I care too much about image. But hey, I'm a girl. Of course girls nitpick at their every flaw.

I don't really put words to it or quantify it by its characteristics in my mind, but I notice. I don't think it takes away from your looks at all, and I think you are very pretty. I think you are uniquely pretty. Sometimes idiosyncrasy is attractive. I don't know. I don't blame you for feeling some way about your looks -- it's easy to do when you're always paying so much attention to yourself. I do it too. I can imagine it is difficult for a woman: your being perceived visually may potentially affect a whole bunch of things, just due to what everyday life as a chick is like. So all those possibilities are just more things to worry about and respond to as though they were actually happening. Like your pregnancy test. Yes? But you're pretty. And I like your look. And if you want me to tell you a million times, I will even tell you a million times.</p>

I feel like you have to be pretty sensitive person for it to mean much of anything to you. It's just a feeling I guess, when I interact with someone. When I get a feel for their personality and energy, I tend to associate them with certain colors, and that helps me wrap my mind around who they are, and what core values they have, and what kind of behavior I can
expect in them. Blue is very dependable, stable, deep, mellow on the surface. Yellow is a very joyful, simplistic, impulsive color. Most times, people have one main color, and then show a slight bit of one or two others. I don't know. I'm an artsy person. I can relate to colors. They evoke very specific emotions and gut feelings. If I pinpoint colors in a person, it gives me more of connection to them. Some people I know right away what color they are, and that makes me feel like I understand the core of them. What makes them go, and why. Other people, not so much.</div><div><br></div><div>Asymmetry can be awesome sometimes. I like quirky things. So I suppose for the most part, I like myself.

<p>I frown at birth control like I frown at antidepressants. I can tell you are worried.... it's somewhat alien to me, but I understand. I've never used a condom in my life. That's who you are talking to. I don't throw my dick around and etc..... it's not something I'm actively doing. And nothing has ever come of it -- I'm safe, childless, all of that.

Maybe it is good that someone else is considerate in such cases. </p>
<p>birth control, though? I don't know. I don't like it. I don't like all the tinkering with such valuable machinery..... too dangerous. Too many variables. I write it off in my mind: I tell myself there is some better alternative. But what do I know, really. I am just babbling.</p>

You match them up with colors.... and now you understand the pieces by analogy, according to how the colors relate to one another.

<p>I have also been running around in the rain for a while. Temporarily sitting myself somewhere. I think Justin is trying to fall asleep. We are outside.</p>
<p>we walked past the abandoned basement maybe a half hour ago. We're stashing our things there rather than walking around with them -- I can't hit on all the ladies with the shaved eyebrows if I'm carrying a bunch of personal effects on my back, you see. Justin says he saw all kinds of uncharacteristic activity at the spot, as though someone were in there looking around, but he is paranoid, and I didn't see anything. What to do, what to do.</p>
<p>I always liked the word "paranoia...." or "para" "noia," as in, "beyond" "mind." Likewise.... "psycho" "pathic," as in, "mind" "illness." Just a neat little thing that interests me. Did you know that the term "night mare" was originally coined to describe the entity who visits you in your sleep and sits on your chest, just as you have experienced? Those are the types of suckers I am glad I am able to avoid with my lucidity as I dream.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Tue, Jan 14, 2014 at 2:59 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_(folklore) target=_blank>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<wbr>Mare_(folklore)</a></p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Tue, Jan 14, 2014 at 4:49 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div>The doc gave me a steroid inhaler to calm my post viral infection bronchitis, as she has determined my cough to be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For the most part, I'm in a good mood.

dir=ltr><div><div><div><div>I've heard the name of the game thrown around and such...... but I must admit, I have never been more enticed to play the game than I am now upon seeing that card.<br><br></div>I was very cold, yes. I was much colder throughout the night as I was sleeping than I was when I first laid down, and it was also much colder than I thought it would be. Justin and I both have sleeping bags that insulate very well, and which are suitable for the weather, but after a while, I could feel myself laying on cold metal paneling even through the bag. I woke up this morning with a horrific chill that persisted for maybe a half hour after I started moving around. Will definitely be shopping for a better idea before I sleep there again, that's for sure. Meanwhile, though, whatever. I'm fine. Not dead or sick. Who cares.<br>
<br></div><div>I grew up here. I was born in Brooklyn, NY, as so many street kids are so quick to emphasize for some reason, but I haven't lived there since I was young. I've been all around Lancaster county. Went to all different schools and shit. Though my network of friends remains kinda dismal just because I ignore everyone. Introvert for life, what's up.<br>
</div><div><br></div>I've tried a lot of drugs. I have an extensive history of drug use starting from around the time I was in middle school or so, but my use has grown consistently more temperate for a while as well. Truthfully, here: I tend to love myself and love being sober, so, for years now, I have tended to gravitate toward doing no drugs. I tend to go for lengthy periods without any drug use. At the same time, though, I know my preferences will naturally incline me toward keeping away from drugs, so I will also sometimes allow myself to do them, understanding I am not at risk of jeopardizing myself by the way I do them. Mind you, I don't do it because I am confused, or because my thinking is compromised by the effects of a drug. I just do it because, sometimes, in some cases, I like to do it.<br>
<br></div>I went to some thing for New Year's Eve this year. Some big rave in Baltimore. I had a friend pay my every single expense just to take me along -- it wouldn't have even happened had he not done this. I had never been to such an event before, either, but it's something I'm able to get into; it's a cool scene. While I was there, I ate a lot of ecstasy. MDMA. It affected me with waves of mania so euphoric I could barely even keep track of what I was doing, just running around excited all over the place. Partying until like 6am at this club full of some 2500+ people all raging hard as fuck on their own drugs. Music and complex light shows blasting the whole time. Could feel the bass in my chest so hard I was almost ready to throw up. I swear I entered into straight trance a few times where I was just jerking around involuntarily to the music and completely hypnotized by lights, not even aware of my surroundings or anything. Spent the whole evening just wandering around in awe, though, talking to people, bumping into new people, whatever. Reuniting with people after having met them earlier. Getting so lost in crowds I couldn't even find the walls of rooms half the time. Petting the hair and clothes of chicks I had never met before, telling them how gorgeous they were, just cuddling with them like running into someone's cute pets on the street. <i>Tripping over bodies! </i>Can't believe I literally saw <i>passed out bodies </i>being nonchalantly carried and disposed of while people just danced around them on the dance floor like nothing was happening. Shit was soooo crazy. Shit was crazy as fuckkkk and I had a greeeaaat time. And it included drugs.<br>
<br></div><div>my thing is this. If you're the type of person who doesn't mess with drugs, that's awesome. So am I. They have no place in your life, so I wouldn't have any reason to concern you with them or include them in our dealings. It would even encourage me to keep my distance from them, and I'm cool with that. I'm ready to do that at any time. But I dunno. You're young. Who knows what your life puts in front of you. Who knows where your head is. Personally, I love ecstasy. I love psychedelic drugs, too. I never find myself
around them, and, as such, I won't do them these days except on some special
occasion, if at all, but holy shit, I love them. So, I mean, if you wanted to just go to raves for a while and party hardy, and steamroll over some cuddle puddles of strangers, and go absolutely fuckin' batshit, hey, that's cool too. I can hang. Just don't pass out on the floor. It'll take me like three trips over your legs before I even realize you're a body.<br>
<br></div><div>I can tell you things about drugs though. If I know you and I know you are doing drugs, I will babysit you. No matter our relationship, I will do this. Real talk.<br><br></div><div>I'm not supposed to be jealous of your breakfast date, am I? Ha ha ha ha ha haha hahaaaedjasdjasdjaslk.<br>
<br></div><div>enjoy your morning.<br></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Wed, Jan 15, 2014 at 8:35 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div>I am quite the introvert as well. But I think I already made that obvious in past messages. That's part of why I got an OkCupid account. I knew if I didn't push myself to interact with other people and get out more, I simply would not. I would be a workaholic and a hermit. Another reason was because I was determined not to let myself be incredibly down in the dumps about the last relationship that very recently ended. I don't have time and energy for that. AND because I felt it's probably healthy to welcome new interaction with men to allow opportunity for me to find and embrace positive qualities in the opposite sex, rather than grow bitter by closing off to them and only using my past shitty relationship experiences as my life compass when it comes to men.</div><div><br></div><div>I find
it interesting that when I look back at poetry from when I was a teenager, I still completely understand the feelings I was expressing, and sometimes I'm even going through the exact same scenario the poem is reflecting on. It's pretty cool. In every other way besides my emotions, I do not agree with the perspective of the younger me. When I find a diary and start to read entries, I'm grossed out by who I was, and end up shredding the pages up because I don't want to read that immature crap again. But on the other hand, the poetry I wrote still applies to me now. I feel so much unity in my life timeline when I read my poetry. Sure, it's not as skillful in writing as I would be now, but what it projects is exactly how I feel in the present. It's freaky that I've changed so much in many ways, but in some ways, I haven't changed the least bit. I feel I'll always follow the same emotional pattern.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm not a big party or club kind of
a person. Maybe that will change. I've also never touched drugs. And I probably never will. I hope I never will. They scare me. I don't like being out of control. I'm very inhibited. Plus, I get pretty high off of life sometimes. I like that high. I feel that it is a genuine high. No side effects, and it's healthy to let myself get addicted to. :-) &nbsp;That rave sounds intense!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Holy cow. I am so glad I am better at saying no to demanding people than I used to be. But it is so damn stressful! brain is fried! If I cared less about offending people, it would be a lot easier. Some photographer chick wanted me to collaborate in an art/photography project with her in which she entirely had the concept figured out in her mind, and would require hours and hours of work on my part for something I'm not really into and is already planned out, so I would have no creative freedom. That being in exchange for a second project that I
would command and come up with the whole concept myself. But I'm not into that. So I told her "because it is not a concept I helped develop and it's not a concept that represents my style of work, it is personally not worth giving up that amount of time and money to me." and she kept pushing me and pushing me for it, saying &nbsp;stuff like "well you said you would like collaborating with me some time" or "What if I reimbursed you for the paint and bought you lunch" or "I have the hair stylist and the model already, all I need is you." and "that's why I told you I would do a second project that you get to choose the concept on." So I had to keep reiterating. &nbsp;"I am sorry to say, because I know you are very excited about this project, but no. This project does not appeal to me. I am very stressed at this point in my life, and I want any TF projects I engage in to be fun, relaxing, creative outlets for me." Which yeah, telling you specific details is
pretty lame of me, but the point is, to write the little bit that I wrote to her to hold up my "no" stance in all took like an hour to formulate what I wanted to say in a way that was honest and least offensive. An hour, and lots of brain cells bursting at the frustration. I get so anxious way too easily.&nbsp;</div><div>Here's an update hours later, because I got distracted in the middle of writing this message to you because my brain is frazzled and scattered. Now she's asking me how much I charge. Which I feel she's just doing to guilt trip me, because I know she can't afford anything. She already told me she can't afford to pay anything earlier in the conversation when she was trying to get me to fold. T_T &nbsp; And I offered her a low ball price that's less than half my normal rate that she still won't be able to afford, just because I feel bad because she keeps hounding me. I have no interest in this project now, even if she could possibly pay
me. I have a bad taste in my mouth from her keeping after me when there are other people out there that she could ask that have more time than me and would be more into it than me. I just know from working with her before that she is very high maintenance and has to have things her way and is one to stand over your shoulder and point and make suggestions while you're working, as if she could do it better. AHHHHHHH! And somehow she thinks it would be worth it to me to toil and sweat under her reign in a "collaborative" project. I really hope she doesn't come up with the money. How much more tense and awkward would that be? She needs to drop it and find someone else.</div><div><br></div><div>Safe to say I am not feeling high off of life in these particular moments. I'm so frazzled, I feel extreme pressure in my face under my eyes. I got so flustered that I gave myself sinus congestion. HAHAHA!</div><div><span></span></div><div>Ok I'm done. Bitch fest is
over.

Your courtesy and patience toward people, I mean. Like.... I could, yes. I lied. I can do it, and I do. But I hate it; I hate it a lot.</p>
<p>being outdoors all the time, one thing I deal with constantly is people just seeing me around and getting up in my space. I want to tell them to just fuck off, get out of here, whatever, and, many times, I do, but sometimes, I am stuck being considerate of what may happen, what issues may arise, or what resources may disappear if I am dismissive, and it keeps me from tending to my own peace, which drives me fucking insane. Half the frustration, too, I swear, is just from my desired reaction being inhibited rather than from the actual pestering. Probably more than half, actually! Most! Most of the frustration is from being inhibited alone. So, I mean, I understand. </p>
<p>this also ties into my thing of finding ways to sneak this or that into existence, finding ways to make people swallow things: you're in my space, you're irritating me, you're going to get the fuck out of here, right now, and you're going to like it, dammit! You're going to smile and laugh when I tell you! I'm good at it if I care enough about it. We can brainstorm sometime.</p>
<p>I think it's cool you're telling me the specifics of your days and your jobs, even though I have little context by which to understand what you're saying. Rest assured that I will likely return to your emails many times in efforts to familiarize myself with their details, as I am interested and care to know what you are doing.</p>
<p>I read my old stuff sometimes. I haven't written poetry since middle school or so, and I would definitely be repulsed if I were to read my old poetry, but I've written plenty of things to expound on my beliefs, my life, my mind, even when I was young, and I like to return to them. I am almost always horrified to the point of discontinuing reading, as I have grown a lot, and can't vouch for anything I've formerly done by my current standards, but I have yet to shred anything up as I'm reading: I need to keep my shit around to torture myself, you see. Also, I like keeping it as a means of incriminating myself to anyone who might be flattered by such a thing. Weird? Maybe. But oh well.</p>
<p>I slept in the shelter last night. It's no big deal as long as I make myself get there early. And the basement is kinda too sketched out to return to at this point. But it's nice to know I can at least stay out and survive if I want to.</p>
<p>I like you better without drugs. There is a big part of me that is interlinked with my drug history, but you will not be missing out by not being a drug person. I am happy that you are not hungry for this or that trivial satisfaction, particularly at the risk of putting yourself in danger. And I am also happy that you do not judge me.</p>
<p>I guess I can expect your next couple of days to be busy. What to do, what to do.</p>
<p>can you tell me something useful about how you intend to deal with me? I don't need it in a hurry or anything. And, really, I don't need it at all: I can work exclusively on signals if I have to. Even if the signals are deceptive, I can do this! I am expert mode. But I kinda just want some shit on the table. Mostly so I can then look at it, reference it, play with it, do things with it in conversation. I think it is good to do this -- better than hiding it or working on it in isolation, I mean. So, yeah. Mostly just for that. But, also, because I'm bugging out a little. Losing my marbles. And I don't know. It's kinda cool.... it's kinda awesome, really. I like it. But I also know how to chillax and get 'er the fuck done so I'm kinda just like..... tap tap tap of the foot! Over here, buddy, friend! But y'know. I'm silly. Just a general little bulletin over here. And gravy gravy gravy. No worries, ever. I haven't even gotten my hands on the fucking phone.</p>
<p>I guess I'll leave you to this email for now and go do whatever nonsense I'm doing. Good morning! See you.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Fri, Jan 17, 2014 at 9:25 AM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr><div><div>mmrrreeoowww,<br><br>phone broke again yesterday.

Imagined plans, basically. Pretty silly of me. Ended up squatting at this super shady basement again, though,&nbsp;just due to lack of options, I guess, or lack of creativity, perhaps, after walking around the streets exhausting myself and doing nothing for many hours. Good times, woo.<br>
<br>set my alarm to wake me up very early, as there is much human activity I can expect in the building that really isn't safe to be around, and it is good to leave as soon as possible. Justin, meanwhile,&nbsp;took off in the middle of the night without me, too paranoid to even stick around and do that. I woke up alone&nbsp;to all kinds of commotion at like 9:45am this morning, much to my dismay. Sounded like somebody was having a fucking wedding reception in the room directly&nbsp;upstairs from my head -- the one&nbsp;room I&nbsp;am sure&nbsp;people&nbsp;are recently messing with, that is. Was quite alarming and had me rushing around very frantically.&nbsp;I did, however, escape on foot, though,&nbsp;rather than in a police car, so that's pretty sweet. Plus I didn't lose any more laptops or phones while I was doing it..... !!!<br>
<br>related&nbsp;note: apparently&nbsp;my current alarm doesn't go off at all. It is a very old and unreliable alarm, you see, from a completely useless old phone I've managed to keep hidden among my things for maybe the past year. I haven't even seen it or tried to plug&nbsp;it&nbsp;in for months...... really should've <em>tested it or something</em> before relying on it to <em>deliver me&nbsp;from a burglary charge,&nbsp;</em>especially since I am <em>not slow at all, </em>but I don't know. My head is somewhere else lately, I swear.<br>
<br>it took me maybe an hour to run into Justin by coincidence later on the street. He seems cranky and agitated. Trying&nbsp;to argue&nbsp;me into panhandling like I&nbsp;owe him something or even give a shit if I&nbsp;have a couple dollars, which I mostly don't.&nbsp;I am unable to have much intelligible dialog with him at all, so I immediately split off and am once again lost some mere couple of minutes later. I suspect it is alcohol-related. He gets&nbsp;a particular way&nbsp;upon coming in contact with any alcohol, you see -- he has a history of alcoholism and it definitely has a distinct effect on his mind. Honestly, though, I can't even tell for sure if that is the reason we are butting heads, or if&nbsp;that is the reason for the signals I am getting. Too little time to evaluate and I more or less&nbsp;didn't even put any effort in before just walking off. I don't know. Something about hanging out with him is just becoming a liability somehow. And I feel like part of the liability is in my own head. And blah blah blah I should probably deal with the shit somehow mumble&nbsp;mumble mumble.<br>
<br>I'm not sure how I feel about using our email conversation as a diary or what the fuck ever I'm doing right now. I feel kinda inconsiderate doing it for whatever reason. Feels like something subtle is inappropriate. Spidey sense. I also feel somewhat negligent just allowing all this nonsense I'm dealing with to spill out within range of another person rather&nbsp;than chilling out and keeping it cool, something like that.&nbsp;I feel this way a lot,&nbsp;though, and I tend to just write it off as irrational or unimportant anyway, so oh well. I am so babbling. I hope you are entertained. I've been standing here at a public library computer for like an hour. All the&nbsp;seated&nbsp;computers&nbsp;are taken! Just standing here like a retard typing while my little daily library&nbsp;internet quota runs out or whatever, I don't know. I never use these fuckers. I'm kinda happy to just have something to write down, though. Process my head and shit. Talk to you. A person! But you, specifically, also. Fucking hell. I have no idea what I am even saying.<br>
<br>I've been very, very scatterbrained. I feel like..... I have many things going on in my life that have enormous circumstantial significance. That is, that I am dealing with many things at one time which each have the ability to have very broad and dramatic effects on how my situation may be turning out. I'm preoccupied with possibilities all the time, you see, so that sort of thing..... it messes with me. It's very real to me. I see lots of things. And I really..... I can't tell whether I am entering into&nbsp;such-and-such phase, where, y'know,&nbsp;shit gets crazy,&nbsp;and I deal with all this silly homeless bullshit for a while as a result of x, y, z..... or if, perhaps, on the other hand, due to a, b, c, maybe a completely different alternative is being foreshadowed to me, and is very awesome, and has nothing to do with x, y, z even a little tiny bit! Granted, I don't really know these things, but I see them coming. I see clues. From all directions, I see them. Clues that tell me things like..... sure, yes, of course! It would make perfect sense if blah blah blah were happening, and it fits the bigger pattern, and..... I don't know. So many&nbsp;<em>possible </em>patterns. Shit is ridiculous. In any case, it's really messing with my head. Especially if there are steps I could realistically take, but simultaneously do not know the correct steps..... holy fuck I go so crazy. So, I mean, if you notice that something is clearly affecting my head -- I feel like it's sooooo evident in my writing style and everything -- maybe it's just a lot of that stuff, and it will level itself out, and who cares, and it's my problem, and yadda yadda. And in the meantime maybe it just turns out that I lose some laptops and phones. But it's gravy.<br>
<br>I haven't eaten for a while, though, just due to waking up late and missing my breakfast n' shit. Speaking of gravy. Maybe that is why I sound so off the freakin' wall..... would be convenient if food alone were the solution to my whole day n' shit, wouldn't it. I dunno. Maybe it is! But either way, I am hungry, and my hour time limit is up, and holy shit I've really been typing this for an hour, and......sdflsdlfdgdgdg. Yeah dude.<br>

were to fully give into it. I hope something good becomes of it though, I really do. I'm still giving her a good deal if she chooses to go through with it. I just don't want drama. Don't like drama. No drama for me please.</div><div><br></div><div>Something useful about how I intend to deal with you? Ummm... I intend to enjoy learning new things by chatting with you via email and picking your brain. And I think that just about does it. Like I said before, you are my polar opposite. Which means I'm interested as hell and absorb whatever I learn of you, but am also entirely set on keeping a safe distance. Which if that endless end bores you or does not seem worth your time, and you were to suddenly stop emailing me, I couldn't blame you. You might look at it as "why water a tree that doesn't bear fruit?" if ultimately you have a need to meet the people you might connect with through online conversation.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm sorry your phone broke.
I'm sorry your laptop dissappeared. I look forward to whenever I recieve a message from you, but don't snap your neck trying to get to a computer mister.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to know more about the panhandling and hitting on chicks. What comes of it? What have you learned from the social experimentation? That definitely interests me. I bet you make off better pan handling than working a low paying job. at least you definitely would in a major city. and there's no taxes.</div><div><br></div><div>You'd hate to know I'm not very giving to people who ask me for money. I used to. Every time. Now I see the world completely differently, and I do not do it. I've had a homeless guy stand there and argue with me because he asked me for some of my tip money as I was packing up one day. The only reason he argued was because it was in front of a big group of people, and he wanted to make me look like a guilty dick. Which I found incredibly rude and
spiteful. I worked hard for that money. I put myself out there for that money. Not for him to stand on the outskirts the entire time watching me, and then try to milk me for it in the end. I didn't budge, and sure some people thought I was a guilty dick. But they didn't see through him the way I did. He wasn't a helpless victim. The way he walked up to me like that money was rightfully his, without him doing or owing a damn thing to me. I don't reward that behavior. Not any more. I won't allow myself to be used in ways that I have control over. I'm sick and bitter from being used. It makes me nauseas to think of how many people have used me without conscience. It's like they don't see me as a fellow person struggling to keep my head above the water just like them. They just see me as an empathetic sucker. A toy. And for that, I'm fighting against my empathetic suckerhood tooth and nail. I give when I feel it in my gut that it is for good. I don't give
in to false projections of guilt. Or false projections of being a dependable, caring, hero. Now I know it was just stupidity and naivity. Armando cured me of that.</div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sat, Jan 18, 2014 at 12:10 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>I see I just got a new message from you.

<br>with me, it's&nbsp;the same as I'm sure I pretty much brought up elsewhere, in some other recent email: if I were to evaluate whether people asking for things deserve to receive the things, I would probably never give anything to anyone.

Instead, I think it is better for people to just have things. Yes, yes, more, more, more, all the time. So: you need an extra&nbsp;dollar for your blunt? You need me to sit down in the middle of the sidewalk to roll you a cigarette? I know that feel, bro. Sure.<br>
<br>that's where I <em>try</em> to come from, anyway. Prefer things that way, at least in my mind. My actually managing to have my conduct reflect my position&nbsp;in real life&nbsp;is always varying, though...... depending on how readily I am able to care what bullshit some other asshole needs. Sometimes caring is completely unrealistic. Assholes everywhere. Sometimes I just don't want to do it, fuck your cigarette, get out of my face. I look at my present circumstances as a sort of alchemy in that respect: maybe if I sleep on enough metal paneling and have enough laptops disappear I will be more quickly inclined to appreciate the benefits of being helpful or generous unto another person when it matters. Maybe if I&nbsp;master the art of not&nbsp;worrying about having a bed or a phone, there will be fewer considerations on my mind when it comes time to evaluate how difficult it is to sacrifice something for a person. I could go on and on, but ehh.<br>
<br>you reference over and over this concern that your energy is correctly allocated -- be it so vampires do not target you, or so you are not otherwise exhausted, or so circumstances may proceed in such a way that your correct allocation of your energy is not compromised. I understand this issue very well...... but to me, the only way to do it is the way I do it. That is: with no regard at all for the apprehensions that will keep me from doing it. I can teach you, you know. I do it to everyone.<br>
<br>1:20 before my computer quota runs out. It's hard to really structure a message with a timespan looming over my head, I must say. In any case....... I will talk to you when I talk to you. And no worries. And eheheheheh.<br>

I tried to ask around, but the only fuckers I even talked to had no direct involvement and told me a bunch of speculative nonsense about how they throw unattended bags away, it was probably in the dumpster, blah blah blah. I assumed someone had just used the excuse of my not picking it up to run off with it, because I couldn't imagine it actually having been thrown away. But I ended up asking around and found out that it had been stashed away in an office. So now I have it. My life feels like a fuckinggg...... video game you never play, grumble grumble. Booooo.

4-date week is officially over. and now It is Monday. Wooooooh! And oh yeah, Hi, here I am. Sorry for poofing for so long! There was much to do! But this evening and all of tomorrow I will be staying in. Which I am looking forward to very much. :-D &nbsp; Painting and baking and writing and shit!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I went ice skating on Saturday and was reminded that it is the uncontrollable, slippery, cold version of roller blading. and I love roller blading. So I think I will just stick to my roller blading at skating rinks every once in a while. Ice skating is officially out of my system. Proud that I did not fall on my bum though. :-)</div><div><br></div><div>Oh no, I'm glad you got out in time, despite your alarm never waking you. I hate when then happens. Though
it's never at the alarm's fault. It is always entirely my fault. Sometimes I start to set it and fall asleep before I save it. Or I accidentally set it for PM instead of AM in my sleep-drunken state. Or worse off, I set 2 or 3 alarms for myself, and I sleep through all of them. I trick myself by incorporating them into my dreams, or I push snooze over and over again, forgetting that there is a max of 3 snoozes before it just stops going off. Those days I hate myself pretty hard by the time i wake up and miss something important, or have to do very important things while very unprepared because I managed to wake up last second. Which sometimes is worse than altogether missing those things.</div><div><br></div><div>My head is also elsewhere. I think all the crazy radio waves and things in the air are throwing off my little brain cell nerve endings and their little electronic waves. Something like that. Arrrrg!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I gave myself
a sinus headache today from going for a walk in the cold without wrapping a scarf around my face. What a wimp. Hahahaha! And let's see... I practiced for an exam I have coming up later this week to finalize my license. aaaaand I gave my friend a long, wonderful foot scrub and foot massage. Because I do that kind of thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Justin's an alcoholic... well that's a bummer.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't mind you using me for diary purposes. That's slightly better than writing "dear diary" isn't it? I think so. Dear Bekah. A Bekah is reading this. It's nice to know someone is considering your words other than you and the inanimate diary that you would be addressing.</div><div><br></div><div>So are you trying to say you are trying to wrap your head around the steps you would need to take to not be homeless? Or are you saying you're trying to piece together the general circumstances of your life right now to see where they are going
to take you? Or how they have taken you to where you are now?</div><div><br></div><div>This may seem really really dumb. but I have to ask straight out. Do you want to be homeless right now? Are you enduring it by choice?</div><div><br></div><div>I hope you do alright through this nasty snow storm tomorrow. Starting at 4am. I'll be wondering. Shelter tonight?</div><div><br></div><div>I do have a lot of concern about what my energy goes into. I don't have enough time and energy for all the people and tasks and things asking for some of it. So how then can I not be selective and concerned. I have to prioritize those things from most to least important. You say you can teach me but... I don't know. Are we talking about the same thing with the same circumstancial foundation to begin with here? I often don't even stop enough to take care of myself. Constantly running running running, trying to keep up with demands that I have allowed to start growing. And
while I'm running, the end of the line that I am trying to get to is moving further and further away. Chasing and chasing and chasing. My brain is always Saturated. I forget things in an instant. I have selective hearing. Selective memory. I trip over one thought when I'm trying to follow through with another. Ooh I need to text this person back to this person. Oh shit I forgot to answer this person too. Ooh I need to answer that email I got 2 days ago that I didn't answer because I had to rush out the door. Ooh I haven't done my laundry for two weeks. Ooh I really need to make a decision about that one thing and get back to the person. Jeez they haven't heard back from me in 3 weeks. Ooh I'm late for work. Oops, my tank is on E. I'll remember to fill it on my way back ,it'll make it right? (forgets) Ooh I need to run this errand. Oh shit no they're closed, I'll get to it tomorrow morning (never remember until they're closed again). Ooh a shiny thing.
Ooh that makes me want to do crafts. Ooh my room is so messy but I'm gonna start this craft project. Ooh, I can't finish it because I have to go run off and do that other thing. I guess I'll just leave it there in the middle of my floor to trip over. Ooh I should do this accounting but I want a nap. Ooh!</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, I can't keep focused on a damn thing. Short term memory loss prettymuch. Constantly wired trying to keep tabs on everything. I write everything down too. And still have a hard time focusing and remembering.</div><div><br></div><div>And yes, sometimes caring is completely unrealistic. Because assholes are indeed everywhere. Just as you say. Which I hate. That makes me unrealistic. I have to counteract my natural idealistic humanitarian tendencies. Otherwise I simply would not survive.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm very glad you recovered your laptop. That must be a relief. :-)</div><div><br></div><div>So I've been trying
to put a positive spin on my past experiences. On people that make me feel bitter and angry and helpless and upset. I don't know if that tactic will really help me feel a damn bit better, but holy hell I'm desparate. Ugh. I was taught actions speak louder than words. I have a better eye to spot wolves in sheep's clothing. I catch manipulative and headshrinking tactics likes it's my job. I take less shit than I used to take. I see my insecurities, I see my strengths, I see my natural tendencies. I feel bitter and hurt, but I guess nothing replaces experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the most famous artists had very traumatic or depressing lives. Beautiful things come out of going through hellish experiences in life.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm trying so so so damn hard to be positive. I'm afraid of me decieving myself and finding out later I'm just burying instead of purging.</div><div><br></div><div>I hate that the people I've given
myself to are the ones I despise the most. And I can't drop it in my mind. I'm reminded of them so frequently. They're always lingering in my subconscience, waiting to get drawn to the surface by any little thing. I'm fighting internally. Half of me is disgusted, hateful, angry towards them and myself. Half of me knows I wouldn't be who I am now without opening up to those people that I wish I never opened myself up to. I guess it's bittersweet. Dominated by the bitter. But one day maybe I'll taste more of the sweet.</div><div><br></div><div>I keep fantasizing about running into Armando, or having Armando contact me, just so I can tell him to go FUCK himself. So that I would know that he knows that I know what he is, what he did to me, and what I think he deserves. Or I switch it up. I fantasize I see him, and he sees that I'm happy and healthy and have built myself up from what he wittled me down to. That I'm more beautiful and desireable than I've
ever been and that he can never touch me again. I want him to know he didn't destroy me. I want him to think it's as if he didn't impact me at all. Because I gave him nothing but love and empathy all the way to the end. I was that lost in the false reality he built around me, while he gave me nothing but lies and and sick mind games and crushed hope. That fuck. He manipulated me so good. I want him to feel the heat of the fire burning inside of me.</div><div><br></div><div>But then I remind myself he's probably too busy tearing new innocent naive young girls to shreds to even reflect on me for one second since the last time he talked to me. Like I was a roll of toilet paper. Wiped his ass and blew his nose on me until he got to the cardboard skeleton. Smash, trash. New roll. How about 3 new rolls at the same time? Yeah.</div><div><br></div><div>I want it to go away.

I feel like I'm cooking. Alchemy. Some ingredients will grace me with better moods and outlooks, other ingredients will grace me with enthusiasm and drive. Some will make it easy to be pessimistic, defeatist, and stagnant..... others will compel me to change things or become aptly sick of whatever I'm doing. I'm trying to perfect the recipe. So while it might suck doing menial kitchen work, to speak partially by analogy..... it is also rewarding to bust out some high-quality meals.<br>

It's a decent-sized studio apartment type deal with its own kitchen and bathroom, coming off the side of my family's house. I used to live in this room. Still has some of my old things in it. These days I am not welcome here: I think my mom just wants to keep me out of sight to minimize the risk that her seeing me homeless might obligate her to offer me something. My relationship with my mom is broken, you see -- none of this is even unusual to me or anything. So I am not welcome here. But my brother will occasionally sneak me in and let me hang out for a while so long as I remain invisible to the rest of the family. And that is what I am doing presently.<br>
<br></div>this same crowd of friends wants to go to another rave at the end of February. Something in New York City. I assume that I am invited after hearing it come up in conversation, but I don't have any money, I'm not sure I will acquire any, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving other people stuck dealing with me. There's also a part of me that is getting hungry to transition into a totally different mindstate, where I reject parties, where I focus more on just dealing with whatever immediate bullshit I deal with.... but I don't know if I will listen to that part of me, and I should probably see what my life is like for a while now that Justin is out of the picture before I even decide how I feel about it.<br>
<br></div><div>in any case, I need a costume. A radical costume. I didn't get the chance for New Year's, but perhaps with enough notice in advance this time, I can find some way to put something useful together. I've never been much of a crafts person, either, but I at least have a visual artist's eye. Maybe I will magically stumble upon the right gear. I keep wanting to fashion myself some kind of headdress or winged cap or some shit, too. Maybe with mock dreadlocks instead of feathers. Even before the party, I wanted to do this! And I have this neat little idea to incorporate some weak electrical devices into wrist jewelry, maybe, or gloves, for the purpose of passing live electrodes into the hands of unsuspecting partygoers as though they were toys, gently electrocuting them by surprise, and totally blowing motherfuckers' minds. But the chances of my ever actually making any of this happen may well be zero or fewer.<br>
<br></div><div>at this New Year's thing, I was introduced to the ex-girlfriend of the same close friend who brought me to the party. She and I get along pretty awesomely since having first met, each interested in what the other is doing and so on. Complimentary energies. But I guess she and the dude are dating once again, and now I'm not sure what manner of relationship is even appropriate between us any more. Either way, she will also be going to the rave. Probably spending a lot of time with me, too, if I'm there. What's worse, I've already shit on this poor guy so much by falling hard for one of his other ex-girlfriends a while back. I thought it necessary to pursue her and I know it hurt him. Now I feel bad even casually flirting with this one. It's just some weird little crate of gunpowder in my peripheral vision -- one that I can hopefully deal with correctly before any more fireballs start flying around. But one I consider so long as I am also considering this rave.<br>
<br></div><div>my brother keeps interrupting my typing by telling me some totally trivial shit. He is an anxious personality, you see: always jumping from here to there to engage himself, in a reactionary sort of way. To him, it is useful to circumvent his mental downtime by whatever means of distraction, and it is from that reference point that he experiences other people. I am the total opposite: I love my head; I want it to be disturbed from its place as little as possible. He doesn't understand, and I know he doesn't understand, so I overlook it, but holy crap. <i>No, I don't give a fuck what you saw on your Facebook. That's why I hide those posts on my own Facebook. </i>All this chit chat about nothing is driving me bonkers!<br>
<br></div><div>I kinda wanna type more, but maybe I will just save it for another time. Hope you are enjoying your slow day off or whatever...... mumble mumble.<br> </div></div>

Most of the time they are very relevant. And you could argue that they are vague, but at least when I feel that it is a message directed specially towards me, it brings me to reflect on whatever aspect of life it is calling me to reflect on. i like it. It keeps my mind on the right track. It reminds me not to get lost in negativity or stressers, or to watch out for certain things. And my sign is spot on with my personality now I think, so it's written to me in a way
that verifies my way of thinking. It makes me happy. It gives me a little something extra. That's what matters right? Today it's telling me I have very good reasons to blame Armando for my current state of mind, and that I have every right to tell him off. But then it asks me what that would really do for me in the big picture. Sure it would bring me a few moments of release it says, but ultimately it would bother me that I had said things that were hurtful, because it is not like me, and that I should use my energy to find a solution instead.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>See why I like it? It levels with me. Hahaha!</div><div><br></div><div>Mr. Military Man whom I went on my first OkCupid date with when I got the account in December has started texting me against, trying to headshrink me so he can get in my pants. Holy cheese. I guess it's to be expected. I guess he just doesn't realize that being told over and over again how boring and dull I am for
not wanting to engage in the most wonderful sex of my life with him is not a turn on for me. I'm not going to be like "Oh, so that's how I become an exciting and interesting person!? Gosh, I feel so stupid for not taking you up on the offer sooner! Oh look, I'm instantaniously naked and at your disposal. Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to be deemed interesting and fun!"</div><div><br></div><div>It's kind of fun arguing with him though. Playful arguing. He intentionally pushes my buttons to try and get a rise out of me because I'm "adorable when I'm angry." Haha, whatever tool, I'll play your game. I'm reading into him more than he thinks I am. I consider him a challenge, since I already know him to be a sociopath. Sociopaths can be fun and pleasant to be around, so long as I keep on defense. And that is true for him. Very funny, very flirty, very attentive, very insightful. I'm playing with human fire. Is this a bad idea? Eh? I'm challenging myself,
standing my ground, staring the threat in the eye with a grin on my face. Sure buddy, play your games, test me, try and find a way in. Ain't gonna!</div><div><br></div><div>Oh god this is rich. "I love arguing with you. You are adorable when you get angry and argue. We would have had a very great time in bed. Just saying. Not that I am interested in that anymore."</div><div><br></div><div>God this amuses me. I told him it's a good thing he doesn't want the unattainable. I bet that's gonna sting and make him grin ear to ear all at once. I'm challenging his ego. HAH! I guess I enjoy provoking him too.</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, talking about something else now.

There are a few key differences, however: for one, its programs don't do anything to place anyone in any job or help in finding employment. They just require their participants to work or seek work. Two, they do keep a percent of workers' income, yes. And the stated purpose of keeping this percentage is, indeed, to help participants to save a lump sum for themselves, with which they can then do something useful, like submit a down payment on a lease. But what usually ends up happening instead -- ridiculous as it may sound -- is a participant will be penalized for breaking some trivial rule, like coming in late, for example, or fraternizing with members of the opposite sex on the campus, or catching an attitude with the wrong staff member in the wrong mood. And then he's kicked out of the program. And he's no longer eligible to claim his money.<br>
