I will most likely end up leaving for the street tomorrow. I've only managed to delay for as long as I have on the merit of my offering to spend some food stamps on my brother's groceries, as I only received my next month's food stamp allotment on my empty card just this morning, but, once we go shopping, as I'm sure we'll do this evening, I expect I will be rushed out of here sooner rather than later. But oh well. One more evening is nice.<br>
<br></div>curiously, since I've been here, I've felt guilty, being prodded by my conscience to return to the street for the specific sake of the people I deal with when I'm there. It started off as a pretty strong compulsion, too, closer to the time when I first got here, but, as time has passed, I've seen my consideration wane -- most likely due to a combination of my dissociation from the environment, my further investment in being comfortable here, and, especially, my entangling myself deeper in my cigarette use, which has only proceeded with the assistance of a corresponding set of unhealthy psychological behaviors. Either way, the experiencing of such a compassion that I am moved to choose <i>against </i>a relief from my own homelessness is an <i>incredibly </i>novel phenomenon to me, and it's been a pretty interesting and useful time as I've observed just what factors have influenced this state and how. <br>
<br>if you'll excuse me: it's so freakin' crazy, dude. It's so, so crazy. I consider myself responsible, you see, for disrupting this process that is literally the <i>accepting of infinite gratuity unto my soul. </i>Plain and simple, that's what it is. Like, free eternal life for me, but, oh, hey, I'm here doing some dumb shit like smoking a cigarette, whoops, don't mind me. Seriously. As such, as you might expect, I believe myself to be something of a very huge asshole. I <i>am </i>one. Simultaneously, though, I'm still really, <i>really </i>excited, because I see that I am being encouraged powerfully toward goodness, even to the extent that being an asshole is becoming very, very difficult. Like, I can tell myself stories about why I'm <i>wrong, </i>and why I shouldn't be hopeful, as always, but it's getting <i>so crazy </i>at this point, and I've seen <i>so much, </i>that I'll have a hard time even believing the stories I tell myself, and it will cost me more effort to devise such stories than it even will to realize why I am hopeful, which remains right the fuck in my face. And I'm just happy. This train is <i>going </i>somewhere. I <i>know </i>it's going somewhere. Count on it.<br>
<br></div>I walked to the grocery store earlier today. The nearest one is something like a 40-minute walk from where I am, but I walked it just for something to do, and so I could browse a diverse selection of junk food with which to stuff my face in lieu of my refusing to smoke any more of these awful cigarettes. I seriously spent, like, the whole walk, there and back, just singing, and dancing, and talking madly to myself, as if in some kind of trance. All of which was actually just <i>prayer, </i>by the way, but my <i>goodness, </i>my head is ready to pop right off, no joke. I love it.<br>
<br></div>I found a rose sprouting from the ground, during my walk, and I immediately thought to pick it up and give it to my mom for some reason. It was right down the street from the house. So I plucked it out of the ground by its root, I headed straight to this room, and I put the rose in a container of water, but it looks like it is already wilting, even though it's only been there for a couple of hours. Now, I haven't talked to my mom for a year, and I have no idea how I would even go about talking to her, if I did, but I wanted to leave room for the possibility that some unforeseen circumstance would arise in which it made sense to give her the rose. I am still hopeful, truth be told. But it's late.<br>
<br></div>I don't know what you're doing, and I'm sure it's none of my business at all, but you should be careful you not jump into bed with Philly man, or with anyone. I know the temptation to consummate or establish something can be strong, but you would do well not to endanger yourself any further by the same vulnerability to illegitimate emotional influence you are already trying to avoid. You will hurt yourself -- particularly in the case that there is not a proportionate commitment or relational bond. I'm sorry to tell you such things, really. And I don't expect such behavior out of you, in any case. But it's nothing personal. I tell the same things to everyone.<br>
<br></div>I'm taking a break. May write more later. Here, have some music.

It's funny: I didn't want to <i>ask </i>him to do it, as I understood my doing so would put him in a position where he would be left either acquiescing or refusing <i>my own will, </i>and I considered the approach to be too heavy-handed, just as I did the prospect of my forcefully delivering the rose myself right into my mom's face. I've come to appreciate the value, instead, of leaving room for determinations that <i>are not mine, </i>not unlike the casting lots I've seen done in the Bible: I view it as akin to, say, breeding selectively for submissive traits, except, instead of producing animals fit for domestication, I am cultivating circumstances that are not bound by an adherence to my own preferences. Neat, huh? I think so, at least. In any case, I didn't want to ask my brother, but he, knowing that I had collected the rose, volunteered of his own accord to deliver it to my mom, and I considered this outcome rather agreeable, so I did not stop him.<br>
<br></div>when I first saw the rose, I immediately thought to take it and give it to my mom. This impulse was rather uncharacteristic, even to the point that it was bizarre, and, on that merit alone, I found myself immediately attributing significance to it and expecting something to come of it. I resolved to manipulate the resultant circumstances in my favor as little as possible, in order to better gauge and not disrupt whatever was happening, but, at the same time, I prayed. I prayed that the rose found its way to my mom, and I prayed that it not lose its life or its luster, in order that, should my mom receive it, she would like it, and she would not be left with a dead or worthless flower. My mind is pretty radical, so I was playing out all kinds of outrageous scenarios in my imagination: everything from my mom incidentally seeking me out in my brother's room to the rose supernaturally blooming in impossible health, I imagined. I was so convicted I even intentionally kept from researching how best to care for the rose, opting instead simply to pray. But, by the time I emailed you yesterday evening, with the day having already passed and the rose already wilting after a mere couple of hours, I had all but dismissed these things.<br>
<br></div>as it turns out, my brother offered to deliver my mom the rose. As it turns out, also, the rose wasn't even a rose. It was a tulip. The tulip, apparently, is my mom's favorite flower. And, according to my mom's knowledge of her favorite flower, the tulip, as it turns out, is one of the only flowers that, upon having its stem clipped and <i>then </i>being placed in water, will continue to live and grow without being rooted in the ground. So now it's living and growing. What the <i>fuck, </i>right?<br>
<br></div>I never went boating, but I went tubing, once. My two brothers and I were all brought with my uncle, his girlfriend, and their kids, during a brief period in which our extended family sought to accommodate us immediately following our dad's passing. We all floated downriver for a while with two people on each tube. I remember bumping my tailbone up against some rocks jutting underneath
me a few times as we went -- my butt was hanging down somewhat into the
water. My youngest brother was on my lap, being maybe five or six years old at the time. It was peaceful. Suddenly the slow stream transitioned abruptly into violent rapids and we found ourselves plummeting over a series of steep drops and irregular waterfalls. All of us were overturned and bashed against the rocks. I lost my inner tube and sheltered my brother with my body. The water tossed us variously about, and I could do nothing. There was a point where I stood, somehow, on sure footing, and threw my brother, over my head, to the safety of the nearest riverbank, and it doesn't fit with the continuity of my memories at all. There was another point where I desperately grasped at my uncle's hand from the water as he reached to me from dry land, but, as he hastily assumed he had secured my safety in his rush to tend to the others, I slipped back toward the water, and I was barely able to get his attention and elicit his hand a second time before being swept away. It was terrifying, and I did not think I would live. I didn't know this at the time, but we were only rescued with the help of a hiking party that happened to be immediately nearby and see us. My uncle's girlfriend's daughter, who was only three years old, was lost in the accident. She was separated from us when we flipped over. It took days for search parties to even recover her body, and her face, at her funeral, was mangled. None of this even really <i>bothered </i>me as it was happening: I was shielded by shock, I'm sure. Neither does it bother me now to remember or talk about: it was so long ago, and it's all just memories. But this is what I think of when I hear of your boating and I see your picture.<br>
<br></div>I'm sorry your hormones are disruptive. I've been masturbating, myself, recently, which I'm not too pleased about. Not that I hold myself to some arbitrary standard for the sake of doing it, but I definitely do prefer myself with a clear mind, would rather I not give such credence to my impulses, and am not much a fan, at all, of my conceding to encourage myself toward carnal indulgence rather than devoting my instances of consciousness to its resistance, which I know I am fully capable of doing, so, for these reasons, I am convicted in my heart against my behavior. Long story short, though, before I babble any more ridiculous nonsense about myself: I commend you for getting off the shot. I commend you for undergoing difficulty in pursuit of a greater good. And I commend you for being inclined by your difficulty, yet not allowing your inclinations to be your master. These are all things I appreciate a lot, and I am happy about all of them.<br>

In retrospect, I believe the majority of my dreams were made to be obscured, intentionally, in order that their elements of spiritual attack would then be most effective.<br>
<br>most clearly, I do remember a peculiar instance in which, after having earlier, less coherent circumstances illustrate a context to me for a time, I was observing my own behavior being committed from a much more lucid and first-person perspective. It was convincing, as though I was exercising my own volition in the dream, and I was brought to a point of summary, where it made sense that I was explaining the cause for my own previous behavior I had seen. So, from this strange and deceptive position, observing myself and simultaneously believing I was responsible for my own will, I spoke.<br>
<br>I was in the process of emphatically accrediting a <i>girl </i>for my action, as though my dedication to her in my heart was the sum total of the reason I did what I had done, and all of this seemed a completely fitting climax to the dream scenario I believed I had seen and understood. Suddenly, though, I became urgently wary, knowing my wrong attribution of these things was of demonic origin, and, in resistance, I willed that the name of Jesus would replace this girl's name as I spoke the sentence that culminated in the speaking of her name. Two times, I was made to speak this same sentence in which total credit was to be appointed to this name. The first time, I heard the name "Judith," which was an attempt to deceive me by the mimicking of the sound of Jesus's name. I willed I repeat myself, and the sentence came forth again. This time, I heard a name that sounded nothing like the name of Jesus, and that, instead, dripped with disgust, sounded very much like concentrated blasphemy, and was in deliberate defiance of my attempt to speak Jesus's name. I was immediately shaken awake at this point and found myself speaking the name of Jesus, aloud, with my mouth, in rejection of what had transpired.<br>
<br>I could tell I was still in a partial sleep state. You know when you wake up, but you're still half asleep, and you're able to fall back asleep very easily, and even transition right back into the dreams you were in before you awakened? It was like that. It was hypnagogia -- the altered state of consciousness between sleep and wakefulness in which dream imagery first begins to appear. I am familiar with this state. It is not unlike the state induced by meditative or yogic trance. From it comes a greater receptivity to spiritual stimuli and a corresponding greater vulnerability to spiritual attack: indeed, it is from this state that everything from lucid dreams, to astral travel, to the spirit contact of sleep paralysis comes. Knowing this, I readied myself, strongly considering Christ in my mind. I expected I might even be faced with something so profound as my falsely awakening into a second layer of a dream, I wanted to ensure I was prepared, and I could still feel something of a demonic presence upon me. Eventually, though, it left me, and I felt contented to return to sleep.<br>
<br>though this instance was the clearest and most easily communicable instance of my suffering spiritual attack, the attack continued for some time throughout the night. It affected me by many avenues, and it affected me all throughout the phases of my sleep cycle. There was at least one more case where it pursued me even to my wakefulness, where I was left to ward it off yet again by speaking the name of Jesus aloud. It was frightening, in some sense, while it was happening, but I am not at all a stranger to these things. The attack ceased, eventually, as the night went on, and, as far as I am concerned, it amounted to nothing. I very rarely have this happen. I blame the energy drink I consumed shortly before I went to sleep. Not to suggest that these things were merely the result of a drink, mind you, or that they were even merely the result of my own mind, but I allowed them the avenue, and then <i>poof -- </i>through the avenue they came. That's how it works, you see. I am not at all a stranger to these things.<br>
<br>your dream sounds interesting, and I am flattered, but I assure you, your omniscient shapeshifter who wielded authority over your dream environment does not compare at all to my actual being. I advise you not sell yourself short. Indeed, were it me, long before having sex with you, I would minister the gospel to you, just as I do now. Should this being choose to display himself to you again, I recommend you dispense with him just as I recommend you dispense with any other being who ministers to you any gospel but mine: you command him away from you in the name of Jesus Christ, and with complete authority, be it over your dream environment or any other. You are under a seal of spiritual protection, my dear. And should this being choose to display himself to you again, truly, may I bring you his <i>head.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>I'm finally heading back to the street today. I don't know why it has taken so long, but oh well. You may hear from me a little less in the coming days, as I will be in the process of finally correcting the work I've all but undone since my initially committing to quitting smoking, but it depends how cranky I end up being, really. If I feel I can afford to dick around on my laptop without further jeopardizing my meager will to do good, and if I feel I can speak to you pleasantly without frustrating myself into a counterproductive mind by my efforts, you will hear from me. In any case, I will be done dealing with this nonsense much sooner than later. Count on it.<br>
<br>enjoy your day.<br><br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Fri, May 9, 2014 at 7:58 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>Today we did mother's day, since my mom works a full day on Sunday.

Typed up some long-ass text that took 15 minutes to really think on. And then I deleted over half of it. and modified some more. Who knows how much time and consideration I put into that baby. All to end up with something pretty short and sweet, I think. And then I sent it and hemmed and hawed about whether I should send something more than that, or if I should just leave it there. Typed something out. deleted it. Typed something else out. stared at it. deleted it. Finally deciding I'm not saying anything more for now, because there's no use wondering how he's going to react. I'm sure I'll get a response from him, and I'm sure it will cause me more anxiety. So knowing that, no reason to think any more about it at this particular moment. Unnecessary anxiety. I have to act against my altruistic and empathetic
nature at times like this. I have to just tell myself. No. Stop. Don't elaborate. Don't make excuses. Don't add more fluff to the paragraph to soften the blow.

I had my 10x10 tent with two tables and chair and all my face painting shit under it. Was having a pretty good time up until... maybe was it 3:00 when the storm hit??? HAHAHA! holy tits.
My cousin was there visiting me to get her granddaughter's face painted, and she was just about to head out since the rain had just started, when a big gust of wind hit and my tent jumped back 5 feet. So we were both grabbing onto the legs of it and trying to take all my signs down and pack up all the shit underneath at the same time. I let go for a moment and another huge gust came. Had my cousin not still been holding on to the leg of the tent, the entire freaking thing would have gone over the roof of the building we were next to. Instead, it flew up, yanked her backwards on her ass, and landed upsidedown on top of her. xD &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank god she's not hurt. man that was a sight. She was determined that thing wasn't going anywhere. Meanwhile, all my stuff was uncovered and getting drenched. and we were both drenched. carried all my stuff over to a corner under the roof of the building that was dry. and made a run for our cars that were both a
block away. By the time I came back the dry corner I had sat all my shit in had turned into a puddle. beautiful. hahahaha!! so... I have yet to go through the bags and see what was ruined.

Pshh.<br><br>well, I'm anxious. Mostly, it's fine, as I tend to know how best to conduct myself to keep from bugging myself out any worse, but writing complicates things, so I'm trying to keep it brief. In short, I could describe better and more specifically, but I'll end up driving myself batshit trying to do it. I spent a significant chunk of my afternoon trying to deal with this. Just irritating the crap out of myself instead of replying to your email like I wanted to. <i>Hopefully I'm done doing it!&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>conversely, I appreciate your emails. They make my days, especially when the days are shitty or otherwise uneventful. Thank you!<br><br>I saw that you had a thing in Lancaster yesterday, since I'm super creep status and I prowl your shit all the time. I noticed at around 3pm, and I thought about rushing to try and force our meeting, but I was too scared to do it, so I just hid in the library's basement for another hour or so, where I remained completely oblivious to the fact that it was even raining. By the time I left and saw traces of the rain all over the street, I wasn't thinking about you any more, and it didn't occur to me that you could've been stuck out in the rain -- I was more preoccupied with how shitty it was that I missed my chance to be stuck out in the rain myself. I am not much a fan at all of this warm weather.<br>
<br>anyway, it's my dinner time. I should be back to normal pretty soon. 48 hours of no smoking just passed, so ehh.<br><br>see you.<br><br>&nbsp;</div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Mon, May 12, 2014 at 12:23 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr>Scarlett has been giving me a lot of trouble lately.<br><br>our relationship is a weird one, you see. Ever since first resolving in my mind that I am not interested in her as a mate, her appearance in my life hasn't messed with me or been an issue for me, and I've been hanging out with her fairly often. I mean, I already see her around all the time, and we are even something like friends. She needs a friend. But she is giving me a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>she remains attracted to me. More than that, though, she is also rather invested in the prospect of <i>my </i>being attracted to <i>her: </i>she believes that, if I act how she would have me act toward her, it will mean something, and it will correctly address her problems. Meanwhile, I am very direct toward her. I make a point to approach her in as platonic a manner as possible, and I will not jump through her hoops, but I do try, simultaneously, to address what she needs addressed, more reasonably, through the avenue of our friendship. It's something of a tricky situation, and she cries for my compliance constantly, desperate to conform my behavior to her own preferences. Because she is so difficult, I am continually struggling merely to interact with her in a way I am able to determine appropriate at all.<br>
<br>she behaves disruptively and obnoxiously. She intentionally presents herself to me as disagreeable, intending to measure, by my degree of persistence, whether my concern for her is genuine. She expects that, should I care about her, I will act like a codependent mate, who, like herself, is of unrealistic emotional investment, and will easily be disturbed from his place by insignificant minutiae. Long story short: she has determined, by her beliefs, that she will not drop her guard and be apprehended except in the case that one treats her horribly. Should we disagree, it is because I am an enemy. My interactions with her, as such, have been little more than my keeping my cool amid a steady barrage of destructive and childish behaviors, acting kindly despite her repeated attempts to elicit my worrying over her invented and fictitious problems. Oh, were she but a <i>dog, </i>this would be <i>simple.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>lately, and much to my amusement, Scarlett has latched herself onto the same exact dude my ex-wife Nicky,&nbsp;in her own attempts to play head games with me,&nbsp;latched onto, herself. She is clearly doing this intending, specifically, to get a reaction out of me. I can tell by how <i>incredibly outraged </i>she is that I will not respond how she would like. Truth is, I am pleased that she has conjoined herself to someone more suited to her level of psychological development than I am. I mean, I don't want her to be treated badly, don't get me wrong, but she definitely does need to learn something, and she will, so, on this basis, I am pleased. And since, rather than being disrupted, I am pleased, Scarlett is <i>outraged. </i>But all of these things will work for good as her futile behavior is more comprehensively exhausted.<br>
<br>just last night, I was hanging out with her, as we sometimes do. Scarlett, apparently, in her attempts to engineer my worry and change my approach, was not satisfied with her merely advertising herself and making herself vulnerable to the sketchy dudes in her company, and decided to take her campaign a step further, ending up smoking k2 with them, also. For the next hour or so, I ended up babysitting rather intensively -- in consideration of what I understood of both the altered state of her head and the danger of her environment, I babysat.<br>
<br>as time passed, I noticed two of the people among us chatting secretly to one another, and I realized they were plotting to rob me for my laptop. Speaking in code about how they would go about doing it, right in my face. I mean, I speak in code, myself. It cost me very little effort to act subtly different, make it less convenient for them to stage the robbery, and prevent the attack, completely invisibly, without even revealing that I had known what was happening. Fuckin' chumps. Even still, though, Scarlett is giving me a lot of trouble. I need to work this nonsense out. I am not dealing with much more of this.<br>
<br>I'm late for my lunch, so I'm gonna go head to my lunch. My day is fairly good. Hope yours is also good. See you.<br><div><br><br><br></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Tue, May 13, 2014 at 4:52 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr>so,<br><br>I was just told, in a conversation with my brother, that, apparently, the night before Mother's Day, my tulip's head suddenly popped off, in one piece, and right in front of my mom's face. I do not understand the meaning of this omen.<br>
<br>as you know, I've prayed, and I've had something of high hopes for the flower. For that reason, I was discouraged. But I realized: it was only the part of me that had <i>expectations, </i>or selfish ambitions about the flower, that was discouraged. The <i>other </i>part, that is suspicious the hand of God is upon the flower, and that believes there is some significance to the flower, is not discouraged at <i>all. </i>If anything, that latter part is even more emboldened by this strange happening with the flower.<br>
<br>I returned to the conversation. I inquired whether the stem was still in the water, not wanting to lose track of it. My brother seemed to be on a similar wavelength: he mentioned that he had asked my mom whether it was possible the flower would sprout new petals, but was quickly told it was not possible. <i>Ha! </i>In regard to my question about the stem, though, I was informed that, while my mom had intended to keep the whole flower, because it meant a lot to her, she ended up just keeping the petals in a bag, and had thrown the stem away this morning. My brother, being prompted by my questioning, went looking for the stem in the trash can of his own will. He found it, but it was snapped in half, so he used a splint to secure the two halves to one another. Now the stem is once again in a container of water.<br>
<br>I started to get this weird feeling that there is some meaning to the flower. Particularly, I was thinking that the head of the flower was my mom, and that the stem was me and my brother. My mom wants to keep the head with the petals, even though it fell off, and it is dead. She threw the stem in the trash, where it snapped in half -- this is my relationship with my brother. But, because of this crafty little splint my brother made, which is the work he has put toward our bond despite our separation, the stem is whole. Then, the flower blossoms anew, which symbolizes my mom being reconciled from this enormous divide that has long existed between herself and us. Now, I like this explanation okay, and it seems to fit with what I am expecting for my family -- specifically, the reconciliation part. But, as I was about to write these things to you, I decided there is another meaning that I like much better.<br>
<br>I imagine the head of the flower, or, in other words, the reproductive faculty of the plant, is our family, but the stem, which specifically nourishes the flower and brings it life, is Christ. The head fell from the flower, dead -- perhaps in relation to the transfer of the flower to my mother's care, and perhaps as a result of the maintenance she performed while it was in her possession, but why, I do not know. My mom, meanwhile, valuing the flower, held tight to the worthless petals, but threw the stem away -- just like she cast Christ away in the process of being separated from my father. She keeps the petals in a bag, just as she has acted superficially to preserve the appearance of our family, but the petals are dead, and she cannot bring the flower life by keeping the petals. Nevertheless, by the combined efforts of my brother and myself, the stem is recovered, just like Christ has been rediscovered by myself and my brother. Then, the flower blossoms anew, which is the reconciliation and the spiritual renewal of our family. I like this explanation much better.<br>
<br>I suspect that, among other things, the flower is an indictment of my mom's wrong approach to our family, and a veneration of my dad's correct one. My dad put God first -- even before the family. My mom did not, and she held my dad's approach against him. It is more than likely this is even the one thing that divided them from one another in the first place. I actually found and picked the flower, last week, on the anniversary of my dad's death. It was a meaningless coincidence, as that's when I first saw the flower, but I don't believe in meaningless coincidences. Can you tell?<br>
<br>(I have no idea whether the flower is going to blossom, btw. I am lost perpetually between reality and imagination.)<br><br>so yeah. I initially started writing this email because I had been discouraged, and I wanted to tell you not to lose your head like the flower lost its head. Seriously, that's exactly why I started writing the letter. On second thought, however, you are welcome to lose your head if you want to lose your head. These things are completely out of my hands. They are better off being out of my hands. I would drop them. I don't know what to do with them. God knows what to do with them.<br>
<br>included below are images of the flower throughout the different stages of its peculiar little life, for your perusal.<br><br>time for my next thing. See you around.<br><br><br></div></font></div><br clear=all><div style="width:50%;border-top:2px #AAAAAA solid"></div><table class=att cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=0><tbody><tr><td colspan=2><b

Not that it was giving me an answer to the challenge, like I thought it was. When I was so desparately seeking an answer, I would try to make any solid answer I could out of the signs. But the only purpose of the signs was to support me, and remind me I'm on the intended path, and that I have a decision to make.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span>Life really does seem magic.

But when they called, they turned around and said they could have someone else on Fridays, and I would just do the earlier week days. So I accepted the job. I feel
very positive about it. It was a roller coaster ride of wondering whether or not it would work out. Kept hopping back and forth. But it's meant to be. I feel content with it.

It was wonderful. I arrived in Philly at
12:30am on Monday night. And I got back home this morning at 4:30am. Did all the driving when there would be the least amount of traffic possible. We ran around exploring Philly both days. Did so much together. It was a heavenly memorable vacation. I forgot about all my worries. Except for worrying what impression I leave with him of course. HAHA! I'm doing my very best to let go of my tendency to worry. I did fairly okay in my attempt to let go of it. My brain was saturated with the city sights. I didn't talk much at all when we were walking around together. I was too preoccupied taking it all in speak. When I did try for regular conversation, it just didn't flow naturally at the time. But goddamn, I was smiling ear to ear and taking deep breaths. Strange euphoria.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span>We slept in the same bed. Some cuddling. 3 kisses. It was so wonderful. We stopped the kissing after the first night though. It was unspoken why, but I think we are both on the same page about it. Out of respect for each other, so we don't get in too deep. And so we know we're not just in it for that. We would both go crazy in a long-distance relationship. Best to keep it to simple enjoyment of each other's company for now. At least as much as we can. It's not something to over-think about. I'm happy it happened.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span>&nbsp;Maybe he doesn't like me the way I like him.

My trouble is my own. I am very silly.<br>
<br></div>I told you I would be happy if you were happy. I don't think I even believed this when I told you. I made the statement mostly for the sake of assuring you, in hopes that you would not feel any more constrained by a superfluous regard for my own silliness -- you do not owe me such consideration, as I've said, and I think it is better that you withhold such consideration. I also made the statement knowing that it <i>should </i>be true, and anticipating that it <i>would </i>be true, <i>eventually, </i>so long as I dealt rightly with my own silliness. I mean, fuck. I told you because it's better that you just believe it.<br>
<br>did you ask me? No. I'm just telling you. Specifically: am I happy? <i>Ehh. </i>Who gives a fuck. <i>Part </i>of me is happy. I <i>want </i>to be happy.

I'm trying to recall what I was up to.... oh yeah! Okay. So Friday I did face painting for an elementary school's spring festival. Lots of little kids with their families. Got lots of cards out to parents. That was 5:30 to 7:30. I have no recollection of what I did before that. Which is kind of ridiculous.</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br clear=none></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>Saturday I was at a fundraiser event. You probably knew about that already though. ;-) That was 9 to 4. Not a
successful, hardly any people showed up other than the vendors. And I'm familiar with that kind of scenario, so I use it as networking time as much as possible. but overall, it's not worth me closing off a Saturday to other opportunities. After that, I went to a birthday party for an old friend. They had a thanksgiving dinner kind of a party, in which we all had to take a shot before we started eating, and were encouraged to drink a lot. Haha! So I got tipsy. Stopped drinking very early on, because I worked the following morning, and because I brought henna and didn't want to be doing drunken henna designs. And because I don't want to get slobbering drunk either way. So I did henna on drunk people. It was great! Though I'm learning I kinda come off like a sassy bitch when I'm tipsy. Not like hardcore. Just a tad. Stuff just comes out of my mouth that shouldn't. Anyways, got home after 9 and passed out.</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br clear=none></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>Woke up at... 6 yesterday? had a face painting gig at a church all the way in York in the morning. A small church. They were having a special day to celebrate the children because they had been praying for children to be a part of their church, and felt blessed to have those kids. and it was a very old conservative church, so I guess they wanted to do something fun and interactive with the kids that they usually don't do. So yeah. Face painting and balloon art for the kiddies. They were a very friendly bunch. Prayed over
us before we started, and told us they had been praying for that day long in advance in hopes it would be a positive experience and bring the kids closer to god. And they were very happy with how it went. They paid me an extra check at the end. Like.. a lot of extra tip money. I was just baffled. That was really nice. and kind of funny how it worked out, because I had an event I was doing later that day that I was doing for free for exposure, and it was pretty much like I just got paid for it!</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>anyways, after the morning church event, visited my grandparents. Grandpa was on oxygen for the day. He's very short of breath. And not eating any more. I'm not sure how
long he hasn't been eating. He has energy/protein shakes of some kind, but that's it. He's still unkind as ever to my grandmother who lost her voice in the past couple days. She answered the phone when I called to say I was coming, and poor thing. Voice is so shot. Anyways, I just feel awful that he's going to be nasty with her all the way to his death. Not cool. Not cool at all. She does nothing but wait on him hand and foot. Ugh. I'll leave it at that.&nbsp;</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>Went from there to my next event for the day, the one I was doing for free. You also may have known about that one if you were doing your research. :-p &nbsp; &nbsp;Tea party / performance being hosted by
a ballet school. I figured it would get me some good connections. Made a point of putting a business card at every table before I started, and getting pictures of most of the kids as I went along. We'll see what comes of it. I was miserable by the end of that event though. It was super hot and muggy in the building and my nose would not stop running. And the kids got more and more demanding by the end. HAHA! But anyways, it went well overall. Went home and my sister came over with the understanding I was gonna be a total vegetable and not very entertaining. Had hot tea together, and I finally started packing some things in my bedroom for the move happening very very soon.</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>Today was my first day at the new job. I am exhausted. Haha! It's chilly in there. I'm surrounded by freezers. and that just sucked all the energy out of me. Hopefully I'll toughen up to it. got back home and was passed out in bed by 5. woke up at 9:30. Ate a veggie wrap. Wrote you an email. That's about how that went. And now I'm ready to pass out again just so quick.</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>I saw a little handmade sign that one of the vendors on saturday had made.

It was a picture of a cat and dog together, with
the cat's paw over the dog's shoulder.</span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div style=background-color:transparent><span>Sleepy time again for me.

Rather, I find myself checking up on you in a very particular set of instances.<br>
<br>most often, I will do it after a period of not hearing from you.
Sometimes, in these cases, it's because I recognize there is a possibility I may have complicated your ability to interact with me by the way I've approached you, and I'm hoping that, by evaluating how busy you are and more sufficiently triangulating your true disposition, I may better facilitate my being rightly considerate toward you in response. Other times, it's just so I can see what you've been up to and how you're doing, very
generally, and no differently than how I may check on any other friend I
haven't seen for a while. Then, of course, there are the times when, after not hearing
from you, I just check on you because I miss you. That is: I check on
you so I can hear from you instead of not hearing from you.<br><br></div>I totally <i>did </i>know about your fundraising event, too, by the way, despite all this outrageous misdirection I swear I just exude completely by accident. I might've known about the other one, as well, but it doesn't sound familiar, so I can't even say. You may be interested to learn, actually, that because I have completely different intentions in checking up on you, when I do, and because I have long since already resolved to keep from intruding on your life and your actual activities, the specific details of what you're doing and where you are, having no particular relevance to anything, almost <i>never </i>imprint themselves onto my memory -- meaning I tend to have no freakin' clue what's on your schedule, at all, even in the case that I already learned what it was.<br>
