I'm trying to figure out what the hell even belongs in one of these emails.&nbsp; ::shakes Magic 8 Ball::<br><br>so hey, you remember that chick I mentioned? The one I couldn't talk myself out of being hopeful about? Yeah. Pretty sure that whole thing is dead in the water. Woo! Shortly after I finished writing&nbsp;that gigantic email the other day, you see, I learned my brother was banging her. Which, I mean..... I dunno, that's all well and good; I was ready to forgive all that shit the second I heard it, really, but.... it's just this stupid situation. Some situation whereby his obstinate fucking failure to examine himself leaves him ignorant of the deceptive and&nbsp;inconsiderate means by which his narcissistic tactics have compromised this girl's&nbsp;ability to reject&nbsp;his advances. So he sees that she hasn't rejected the advances, having a willful disregard of&nbsp;whatever involved psychological precursors and causative factors may implicate him, and suddenly he's this moral fucking superhero, saving the day from whatever&nbsp;big bad asshole has the nerve to undermine the legitimacy of his schemes, being altogether corroborated by the feedback she offers him under duress and whatever the fuck else. Meanwhile, she would be homeless on the street if it weren't for her going along with his bullshit to live in his room, he leaves me out on the street on purpose just to set himself up and sweeten her deal, <em>and, and, and..... he's right to do it, too!</em>&nbsp;Specifically because I'm the asshole who takes some kind of&nbsp;issue with his approach. Holy <em>fuck!</em>&nbsp;I can't even believe. I seriously can't even believe.<br>
<br>I dissed him after that. Cut him off. Fuck him. I was ready to just drop everything, call it fair game, whatever -- I mean, it's not the end of the world. I don't even know what was up with this chick or anything, really. I'm sure another one will come along someday. Something. Who cares. And I know this kid is too mindless to even understand what is what. But when he talks about how they <em>have something,</em> and how it's <em>real,</em> and it's <em>good, </em>I just..... I get so incredibly fucking disgusted. Seriously, I can't even handle. I want to kill someone. I want to jump off a bridge. I think to myself: how <em>dare </em>you waste a green light on <em>that?</em> What the fuck reason should <em>this bullshit</em>&nbsp;prosper in the world? What is so wrong with <em>what good exists, </em>that its replacement with such <em>garbage </em>and <em>poison</em>&nbsp;is so sought after and celebrated? Better yet:&nbsp;w<em>hy do I have to deal with this? Why am I stuck cleaning this shit up? Don't I get to live here, too?</em> And so on and so forth.<br>
<br>you ever wonder why psychopaths do such evil shit, while we're on the subject? This is why. It's because motherfuckers ask for it. Holy <em>shit </em>do they ask for it. Having <em>no </em>understanding of <em>anything,</em> having <em>no </em>ability, having <em>much </em>opportunity to act in complimentary and reasonable ways on a literally <em>continuous </em>basis, but instead <em>wasting </em>said opportunity, every <em>single </em>time,&nbsp;in favor of futile and shortsighted self-preoccupation that goes <em>nowhere. </em>Do you think it is practical for people to act in the ways they act?&nbsp;Do you?&nbsp;To believe their stupid shit matters? To seek reinforcement for themselves? To aspire to a greater influence on the outcomes of things? I don't. Where is the proof? What happens when motherfuckers&nbsp;<em>have </em>all the things? Nobody is driving any of these cars, I swear. What happens is a car accident. A traffic jam. Pileup after pileup. Bodies; explosions. <em>You keep asking for it!</em> Of course the psychopath will take your car away. Shouldn't someone clear a path? Shouldn't at least <em>one person</em> make it the fuck to work in the morning? If you could just <em>drive,</em> we would do something else. We could do all kinds of things. <em>Anything. </em>But this is <em>all </em>you do! <em>Of course</em> we will climb right over your bodies. <em>Of course</em> we will take your cars. The whole road is destroyed because of you. There's nothing else to even do out here.<br>
<br>I don't know. I'm babbling. I think my time at the library is up. I'm gonna go eat lunch..... or k2 for lunch..... or I don't know.<br><br>hope your day is good.</div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sat, Mar 15, 2014 at 11:49 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div><span>Hey you.

better decide quickly. They start on Thursday. It's a pretty chunk of change... bleh. I keep arguing with myself. That's usually how it goes. I am always split in two it seems.

inhibited in that classroom and not learn shit because you're too busy being self-conscious. What the heck would you do with your new and minimal belly dance skills anyhow?

A little clique, we are: hanging out together on a constant basis, taking care of&nbsp;each other's&nbsp;business, breaking hearts and&nbsp;shattering bitches' dreams by hogging blunts to ourselves all the time n' shit. We are something like a family to one another. Each a brother, a sister, a father, a daughter, or what have you. These are about the only relationships I even have on the street these days.<br>
<br><span><span>just&nbsp;last week&nbsp;the one dude went to jail. Probably only for some two months or fewer, nothing serious. Chickie, though, his girlfriend, is like, smoking all day every day, hustling, and swindling motherfuckers&nbsp;all the time. That's just how she lives -- she's lived like this for a while. Her securing resources for herself is&nbsp;largely dependent on her shopping herself around to suckers, presenting herself as though she is attainable, and&nbsp;incentivizing dudes to pamper her and do her favors. It's dangerous, and she is also vulnerable, so this&nbsp;pretty much means she's going to need&nbsp;a babysitter.<br>
<br></span></span></span></span>now I do this wacky babysitting thing. Since&nbsp;last week&nbsp;I've been doing it. She dangles the bait in front of the vultures; I keep dudes from overstepping to the point of threatening her. She runs around trying to make moves like a drug addict, even to the point of overcomplicating her own shit, and I exercise as much intuition as possible in order to keep from stepping on her toes while I play lookout. I make very difficult judgment calls as I do this: her enticing those around her into supporting her tends to rely very much on her appearing to them as though she is compliant, helpless, and will be exploited easily. I am thus left to differentiate real danger from&nbsp;the mere appearance of danger as a general matter of course, left often with a deliberate absence of signals by which I may even make my judgment calls as I do my best to guess whether this chick even needs backup at all, or is just better off looking like she has none. It's <i>so ridiculous.</i> <br>
<br><span><span>we already have a pretty close relationship, me and this girl.&nbsp;I believe&nbsp;her to&nbsp;be a psychopath, herself, actually. I mean, she's really young, and, as such, she is underdeveloped, and we are very different.&nbsp;We're definitely very, very different. But I am confident. I can tell by her attention span and what it's doing.&nbsp;I can tell by the deliberate contexts that accompany her lies, and how they demonstrate her understanding of what others are thinking. I know all the tricks. From miles away I can smell them;&nbsp;I am sure.&nbsp;That said, I am something like a mentor to this girl. Have kept up with her for nearly the entire time I've even been on the street. She interests me. Having her grow up interests me. I <i>love </i>her, y'know? Like my&nbsp;friend Gie and his chick Lilac, I love her. So I tell her what's up, I coach her boyfriend on how to deal with her, I mediate, I do work, all of that. Whatever there is to do, I do.<br>
<br>let me stop and tell you about this other fuckin'&nbsp;<i>dude </i>though. The other dude in our clique. Fuckin' guy.&nbsp;This dude is.....&nbsp;I don't know.&nbsp;How do I put it. Lemme just say, this dude is <i>street </i>as <i>fuck.</i> Real hard nigga type. Dangerous. Gangster. It's&nbsp;the sort of thing where.... you don't go down a street with this guy. You don't even go <i>on </i>the street you <i>see </i>him on. If you&nbsp;come out trying to spend money&nbsp;or scheme on some shit&nbsp;at all, and this dude even <i>sees </i>you, you are <i>toast,</i> and your shit is in <i>his </i>pocket, period.&nbsp;Like that. He is <i>bad news.</i> And, I mean, I'll give you some context, so you understand:&nbsp;I see a <i>lot </i>of bad news. I know a <i>lot </i>of drug dealers, a <i>lot </i>of prostitutes, whatever. I don't just know they exist and see them around; I&nbsp;deal with them; I have intensive relationships with them. They talk to me on purpose! I tell them what's up! They recognize me as their own, because I am arch chameleon mode over here. I am chief commander of demons over here. Real talk. And the end result is I am <i>thick</i> as <i>shit</i> in <i>all kinds</i> of bad news, and <i>none </i>of it fucks with me at <i>all.</i> That's just what my setup is like. But this guy, he is <i>bad news.</i>&nbsp;Even the <i>rest of my life </i>would not fuck with this guy.<br>
<br>so yeah. Somehow, in the course of my ending up with this clique, I've developed a really strong, really uncharacteristic relationship with the dude. <i>Strong,</i> too. Like, mutual respect, mutual understanding; all of that. All this idiosyncratic conversation between us, too,&nbsp;about.... I dunno. Animal planet. Zombie apocalypse. The peasants and the pharaohs. Stepping&nbsp;over people. Being alpha wolf. Deciding who eats. All this undercover, psychopath, spirit world shit&nbsp;you will never know anything about unless I tell you.&nbsp;But yeah. This guy, no joke -- he's&nbsp;like my soul brother. He's older than I am. He knows what's up. I can't even <i>believe </i>I get along with him as well as I do, or that he even gets along with <i>anyone </i>as well as we get along.&nbsp;But we&nbsp;do. We do get along. And it's just this surprisingly serious and valuable relationship while also being a weird little wild card.<br>
<br>it's so,&nbsp;so&nbsp;wild, too, at the same time. I mean, I have a conscience. I have heart and life in me, all of that. Maybe <i>you </i>can't tell,&nbsp;ya freakin' weirdo. You scared little hermit you.&nbsp;But I can tell. We are different. I have that spirit of life in me, and he doesn't. In other words: I'm <i>safe </i>to run into on the street, or in your life, or whatever. He, of course, is not. He's something like the Magneto to my Professor Xavier, you see. And I'm that Blade the Daywalker to his vampires. So, as such, we are at odds, a <i>lot.</i> That is, despite our relationship, he is, quite literally, at my throat, <i>all the fucking&nbsp;time. </i>Ready to <i>squash </i>me when we disagree. Maybe even ready to kill me! And I am, likewise, on his ass, constantly, about how wrong he is, how evil he is, and what have you. Pushing his buttons so hard. Holding him accountable with my professional big mouth and my hyper awareness of his deeds -- no differently than&nbsp;he keeps me in check by being so damn dangerous to my body. Our relationship is <i>heated.</i> And this has never been any more true than it is now as a result of my current situation with this fuckin'&nbsp;<i>chick </i>here.<br>
<br>anyway. Turns out this babysitting bullshit&nbsp;is even more complicated than I thought. I'm still learning, but as far as I can tell, the real situation is this. Hard nigga has been hanging around for a while now. Months, at least. And, this <i>whole </i>time I wasn't around, prior to my inviting myself into this clique, he's pretty much had this girl <i>completely </i>under his spell, locked down and guaranteed, <i>while</i> her man lays the fuck down and lets shit fly, <i>just</i> because the dude is such scary shit. During this time, he's more or less been doing the same exact thing he does now: he's tricking the girl out. That is, he helps to facilitate her drug addiction in order that her artificially engineered appetite will keep her in a position of dependency, and then he gets her involved in this or that bullshit, generating money and taking care of his own business&nbsp;through the use of her work, exploiting&nbsp;her dependency, dangling resources in front of her face, and pushing on&nbsp;whatever pressure points to ensure his total&nbsp;control over her behavior. This,&nbsp;alone, is more or less&nbsp;the whole reason&nbsp;this girl is in a position of requiring babysat in the first place. The dude is expert mode, too -- he's pulled all of this off very subtly, and partially even right in my face, all&nbsp;whilst only first&nbsp;ending up on my radar at all just within the past couple of days. Until now, I thought it was <i>all </i>just <i>her.</i><br>
<br>shit's scary, right? Yeah, I&nbsp;wasn't kidding, was I. Nope nope nope. See, vampires are very&nbsp;<i>real,</i> my dear. They are rather dramatized; rather mythologized: just like psychopaths! Exactly like that! But they are real. Likewise, some of them are very powerful, and some of them really do build these armies of ghouls and zombies for themselves, just like they do in the stories, the fairytales, and what the fuck ever. You ever read any Harry Potter? I haven't, but I sure remember this: fucking <i>Horcruxes!</i> Ghouls; zombies; Horcruxes.&nbsp;Immortality magic. Psychic slaves. It might sound absurd. It is rather absurd. But&nbsp;many&nbsp;of these archetypes and thoughtforms do conform very closely to what actually exists.<br>
<br></span></span>anyway. Demon slaying! We were civil for the first half of the week, you see, and it was all well and good. I just keep seeing all this <i>bullshit, </i>though, and I <i>have </i>to do something. I can't leave it alone. So, what the fuck, right. I expose him! Take the power of his secrecy away! Pretty standard fare over here; I do this shit all the time. Now, then, everything is out in the open. We're overtly at war, and shit is <i>way </i>the fuck retarded. <i>So </i>retarded. Yesterday, for example, I emailed you all hot and bothered after some incident -- some incident, some culmination of our butting heads, where this freakin' guy thought it would be cool to lure this chick up the street by herself,&nbsp;grab her, rough her up,&nbsp;and start strongarming her money out of her pockets, all&nbsp;while his friend stayed farther&nbsp;behind as backup&nbsp;and&nbsp;helped&nbsp;guard&nbsp;<wbr>against me coming any closer. Nasty, yes? I agree, myself, so, I dunno..... I&nbsp;ended up rushing&nbsp;the dude, yelling, talking a bunch of shit. <i>Trying </i>to defuse by nonviolent means, as I really can't fuck with this guy at all in a brawl, but apparently I gripped him up some, too,&nbsp;as he was here grabbing on girl's arm or whatever. This, as you might expect,&nbsp;earned me&nbsp;a mighty flurry of aggravated punches, but hey, I deflected them, gracefully shook them off, whatever,&nbsp;and it seemed like the scale would maybe tip in favor of something actually changing with as crazy as shit was getting between us at this point, so, y'know, who cares. If it's bad enough that something <i>different </i>happens, it's worth it, and that's kinda just how it goes. She escaped; I escaped. He swung on me, but I got him to show his face. Fuck it. Good game. Who cares.<br>
<br>this morning, though, holy <i>fuck.</i> She meets right back up with the dude all over again! Doesn't even put up a fight at all. I try to come with, and mediate, and she and I are on the same page about it, but I quickly took a&nbsp;sharp hook to the face just for being there -- no gracefully dodging today, apparently! Got my phone smashed on the ground, too, while I was there (I originally thought I&nbsp;lost it in the scuffle yesterday, see,&nbsp;but no, this time it's actually gone in real life). I stood at a distance for a minute, playing it off, watching&nbsp;to make sure&nbsp;dude wasn't putting his hands on the girl, because I could tell he was livid, and it looked like he might. And then I just...... took off. Dipped out, took the morning to myself. And it's just like..... what the fuck am I supposed to do? Seriously. What can I even do?<br>
<br>I've seen the girl yet another time, still, since this morning, and we talk about how serious the situation is, and how important it is that she escape -- she knows exactly what's happening! And I know I can't dissuade this guy with force unless I escalate, escalate, escalate. I mean, I'm sick. I'm a sick person. I could escalate if we're gonna escalate. But I <i>know </i>there is <i>no good </i>that way! This whole fucking playing field is this girl's head, and I know it is. I <i>need </i>her head. If I have her head, it's done. But holy crap, dude. She is under such a spell. She really isn't helping me on this thing at <i>all. </i>I have no freakin' idea what I am going to do. I mean, I might let her hang. I might just let her hang until she gets hungry. I don't know. But I think I'm definitely, definitely quitting this k2, like, now. Lead by example, bitch. No more of this dumb shit. Fuckin' <i>wow.&nbsp; </i><br>
<br>in any case, whew. Shit's interesting. It makes excellent use of my skill set -- I consider myself specialized to perform these types of duties; I've found myself doing similar sorts of things in the same types of situations for a really long time. Remember that dream I had about you, even? Holy fuck. All of this is so, so <i>my shit. </i>I'm <i>super </i>good at it. I've never seen anyone else better at it. Not even close.&nbsp;I already consider myself so fortunate, too, and so lucky,&nbsp;to be in&nbsp;this position of, y'know,&nbsp;caring about a person's welfare, and caring so sincerely about a person&nbsp;I will endanger myself to protect that person. So, <i>so&nbsp;</i>lucky. Like, this is <i>precisely </i>what is missing in my life. That caring person is&nbsp;<i>precisely </i>who should be calling the shots around here, and his absence is <i>precisely </i>why my own shit is so fucked up. So, meh. It's something. Whatever it is, it's something. Mumble mumble. I don't know. I'm just so <i>affected. </i><br>
<br></div><div>this isn't even the craziest demon slaying I've ever done, either. Gosh, I could tell you such stories. Remember my ex Galina? The one you remind me of? Fuckin' hell, I had some crazy thing with her a couple years back. Some thing where.... she had demonic entities manifesting to her, brazenly, as visions, through the avenue of her methamphetamine psychosis, and, meanwhile, organized drug crime related people in her life were literally <i>colluding with the entities, working together, </i>to terrorize her away from any means of help and keep her in line! I didn't even <i>want </i>to believe her crazy ass, either -- I flew the fuck to Florida where she lived and scoped it out myself! Even lived homeless on the street in her city when my unwanted meddling had her psychic masters kick me out of her house. Now <i>that </i>shit was crazy! Do you even believe me? I wouldn't say it if it weren't true, dear. I wouldn't!<br>
<br></div><div>I remember when I flew down there. I had no plan or anything; I just knew it was demon slaying. Loved her and so on. Cared a lot, y'know. Figured it was the thing to do. Got there, though, and holy <i>shit. </i>Never before or since have I ever been under such attack. Nobody throwing punches at me that time, thankfully. But <i>psychic </i>attack. Invisible throughout. She was a warped shell of a person: her every spoken word and gesture was at once a scheme, devised to trick me into explicitly corroborating her ways and reinforcing her evils. Every single circumstance, meanwhile, was expertly designed to engineer my will, arranged in such ways that my ability to address my needs and meet my own preferences was in continuous jeopardy, pressuring me to yield at every single turn. Simultaneously, <i>everybody, </i>everyone in her whole fucking life, encouraged her! Gave her congratulations and good reasons for doing whatever shit she was doing. As such, she was a <i>shell. </i>Her own will was completely circumvented. She was a puppet and holy <i>crap </i>did her puppet masters want to kill me. Fucking <i>constant bombardment! </i>For our <i>souls!</i><i> </i>Shit was so intense I can't even describe.<br>
<br></div><div>I told her about Jesus, too. Her <i>and </i>her friends, motherfucker! Make no mistake, I couldn't handle <i>shit </i>over there. I couldn't handle a <i>damn </i>thing. I had supernatural help. So I tell her some things -- I tell her about her soul, and about the irrelevance of worldly consequence in light of the permanence of her soul. Tell her how her soul won't exist if she instead chooses to be this conditional being in response to her fear of worldly consequence instead. All that shit, I told her. Secrets I shouldn't have even opened my mouth about, I told her. And you know what happened? The entities, they gave her dreams. They gave her dreams that encouraged her to interpret what I said negatively and categorize both me and Christ as threats. Sound familiar? I wouldn't say it if it weren't true, dear. I wouldn't.<br>
<br></div><div>it's getting late. I need to hike an hour just to get to my bed. I skipped dinner today, too. And I lost all my layers of clothes. Ohhhh, FML.<br><br></div><div>you're awesome. You are very awesome indeed. Thank you for reading my nonsense. And please have good days n' shit.<br>

Pretty much just told him I'm an asshole and apologized. By coincidence, I didn't have to hike for an hour after all, and am now
in his room. Turns out he was at the same college campus as my library
as I typed to him on the internet, his class was ending right as I
had to leave on my walk, and poof. So that's nice.<br><br>this is after receiving my second cryptic recommendation from a Christian, randomly, earlier today, that I do some vague reparations within my family bullshit, and just wincing in shame at its relevance, convinced that not only is it a manilla envelope addressed specifically to me, but that I'm also <i>lying </i>to myself about it. Fuckin' hell. I can handle one cryptic recommendation, but two? Fine, fine. Leave me alone already. I'm up.<br>
<br></div><div>I think about you often. Not, like, newspaper clippings on the wall often, peeping through your windows often -- I don't even troll your Facebook any more, really; I am too frequently without internet access. But often. A lot more often than I send you emails. Man, I fuckin' hate these emails, by the way. I was just looking through them tonight, too, and I thought to myself: holy shit! There is <i>so much meat </i>in here! These are some of the coolest correspondences I've ever had! So much treasure! And then, at the same time, I hate them. Because I'm stuck writing them, question mark? I don't know. I kinda feel my mind shifting lately, actually: I expect I will soon feel differently about some things. Weird feeling. But, along with it, I feel like my positions are fluid, and that I am not entirely equipped to speak on them. More like: I'm waiting for them to settle. I'm waiting to discover them. Something like that. And among these shifting things is my current take on our pen pal back and forth. I mean, I like it! It's cool! But I swear I fuckin' hate these emails. I don't know, dude. Type type type.<br>
<br></div><div>I have some crazy thing about you for some reason. I don't know the reason. It's probably just <i>no </i>reason. Seriously, I've already gone over all of this a million times -- it's probably just no reason. It's not because you're pretty, although you are pretty. <i>(Even your haircut.) </i>It's not because of your character or its attributes, although I am a fan of your character and its attributes, whether or not they are yours. It's not because I like our interactions, either, although they kinda are some sweet fuckin' <i>treasure, </i>right? It's pretty much just because, poof. No reason. Immediately upon seeing your first messages, too. And it's just this <i>thing, </i>and I want to, like, do <i>this, </i>do <i>that, </i>fucking give up when you diss my Facebook and my phone, can't even <i>do </i>it, what the <i>fuck, </i>dude. Now, what? I'm <i>still </i>here, writing you <i>another </i>email, about <i>nothing, </i>right? Why am I even typing? Do you know this is the only reason I'm even sitting down? Or walking to a fucking library? It's <i>so dumb! </i>And it's like: okay. I don't even know you, bro. I never even saw you before. What the hell would I even <i>do </i>with you? I <i>know </i>it's no reason. It is. If there was a reason, I would have the reason. But even still, it's just, unf, unf. <i>What's next, </i>hump hump hump. I'm doing it on purpose. I'm so doing it on purpose. Do you get me, buddy, friend? Is anybody home over there?<br>
<br></div><div>so I have this <i>thing, </i>and I hate these emails. Yeah, old news. What else is new. But my things are <i>shifting, </i>too. I read your little paragraph the other day -- the one about, blah blah blah, desensitize myself, put all my soul into my work, I'm a lesbian, whatever the fuck you said. Punk. And I swear, a couple days ago, I just wanted to flip shit. Wanted to <i>rage </i>about it, no joke. So slighted. All touchy about it like an asshole. Since then, though? This past week or so? I dunno. Shifting. I'm just happy. I'm happy I have you in my life. (I'm happy I have your emails in my life.) Blah blah fuckin' <i>blah, </i>dude. I have no idea where this is going, really. Nowhere. But heyyy. Hi, hi, hi. And, y'know. Hugs. All of that. Don't hate.<br>
<br></div><div>nyeh, nyeh, nyehhhh. I'm getting the fuck out of here -- before I delete this shit! Quick! Urgent! Ha ha ha ha ha. Good night.<br><br></div><div>(I'm sober, for the record. What's up.)<br></div>

<p dir=ltr>Your world and my world are so different. It's interesting. I can't quite put into words how I feel about it.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I got a might bit drunk the other day with my sister and our friend. It was the friend's birthday. Before we all started drinking, we ate crackers and chips and artichoke dip. A lot of artichoke dip. Too much for what followed. My sister drank too much, puked, I cleaned up the puke, and now I am set on artichoke dip. I won't be wanting any more for a long long time.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I really must get going. There are many other happenings in my life and things on my mind, but perhaps dull in comparison to what goes on with you.

just..... I dunno. I feel a way about it and I've wanted to say
something. I think I even brought it up before, some other time.
Whatever. I'm saying something. <i>Hello, </i>too, by the way!<br>
<div>
<br></div>I've been at my brother's. I kinda totally left chickie
hanging on the street this weekend. Her pleas for my return have slowed
to a trickle. Now she hovers online in the corner of my Facebook chat
window, kinda vying silently for my attention like an anxious pet awaits
a meal, just waiting to measure the urgency of my contacts. I feel
pretty guilty. But I can't influence her by stringing her out on <i>drugs, </i>so what the fuck?<br>
<br></div>I really do appreciate your emails. I go back and read them. I
like hearing what you're up to and where your head is. I like seeing
those gears move. I appreciate your actual <i>being </i>a lot <i>more, </i>though. Your <i>being, </i>y'know
-- whose reactions I can anticipate; whose attention I can specialize
myself to address and subsequently mesmerize like a professional; who
inspires me to offer all this <i>input, </i>all this <i>personality, </i>all these <i>crazy, crazy novels, </i>merely for the reason that she will <i>take </i>them, and that they <i>can </i>be put to use. It's really something. And I really appreciate it a whole lot.<br>
<br>because I am so intrinsically a chameleon, I am something like <i>all </i>opportunities; <i>all </i>possibilities.
I am made of some pretty funky stuff over here. And if it weren't for
audience like yours, you see, this part of me, this very real part of
me, essentially wouldn't even exist. I mean, hypothetically, I could <i>try </i>to
be this person -- this person who does these things, who has these
characteristics, whatever. The person who writes you these novels. Bear
with me here. But, because of how wacked out my shit is, it's like:
without my having a corresponding <i>circumstance, </i>like your receptivity, to make this person <i>relevant, </i>and <i>applicable, </i>to the actual <i>world, </i>the factors by which he is prompted to exist in the first place simply <i>aren't there, </i>and, generally speaking, poof. Neither is he. Instead, I am only the person who <i>would </i>have those characteristics, who <i>would </i>do those things -- but <i>only </i>would in the event that circumstances were <i>different, </i>and appropriate. I only go where I <i>fit, </i>in other words. That's just what my shit ends up doing. Other people, who are without my same hypersensitivity to openings, <i>they </i>don't work like this. <i>They </i>don't
deal with this crap. They are hobbyists. But me? I am corporate. Market
analysis. Supply and demand. Budget cuts; overhead; quarterly earning
reports. No customer? Simple. No product. Is that fucked up, or is that
fucked up?<br>
<br></div><div>I am a <i>whole lot </i>of things. Sometimes I feel quite like the ocean trying to squeeze himself through a tiny little drinking straw. <i>Most times. </i>Most
times, I feel like this. Then, here and there, a dam opens. I have
somewhere to put myself. A container invites me to take its shape. Do
you hear me over there? You are a lovely shape, is what I am saying, my
dear. You, and your perception, and your mind, and its interest, and all
of that. You leave me so much <i>room. </i>You make me so pleased to
introduce myself to you. And it's awesome! Because I am so many awesome
things, and because I know you like them. I am fortunate. I am
privileged. I am <i>blessed </i>to be these things, <i>for </i>you. For <i>your </i>being. Now, I'm not asking you for anything. Don't get me wrong. I don't know <i>what </i>I'm
doing. But I really do appreciate the fuck out of you, like whoa. I am
not confused about it at all. It's just this neat little thing. And you
need not be confused about it either. I don't know dude.<br><br></div><div>::grinds tectonic plates together::<br></div>

<p dir=ltr>Funny you should mention the birth control thing. I was just in the middle of casually forgetting to order a new prescription as I am due for it in the next 2 weeks.

<p dir=ltr>I enjoyed my first dance class. I am so uncoordinated. Oh my goodness. I'm so glad there's only 5 of us and no additional audience. Hahaha</p>

Good morning.<br><br>ran into hard nigga briefly this morning. He joked around playfully with me a little bit, teasing me about how much money I make for being a bodyguard, trying to ask how much&nbsp;cash I had in my pockets -- he had made a similar request about the money in my pockets, entirely seriously, right before he swung on me the other day. I found it endearing. Softened up, bullshat around with him some. He made some passing comment as he was walking off, too,&nbsp;about how he's going to get me back for the phone he broke. This put me over the top: I could tell he was repentant; it totally touched my heart. I ran up to him almost involuntarily and gave him the first hug I've ever given him. Threw some mock punches at him, too,&nbsp;as if to reference the last time I tried grabbing him. It was cute. Cheesy. Really made my freakin' day though. Meanwhile, I don't even <em>believe </em>him about the phone, but hey. Whatever. I fuckin' love the guy.&nbsp;It is what it is.<br>
<br>I saw chickie at my breakfast this morning, too, prior to even having this encounter. She ran up to me and hugged me similarly the second she saw me -- I could tell she was&nbsp;really happy to see me. She proceeded to trip over herself&nbsp;demonstrating she was eager to hang out,&nbsp;eagerly trying to evidence&nbsp;she was not at risk of being swayed by the other guy. I evaluated as carefully as&nbsp;I could while&nbsp;this was happening, and&nbsp;I was clearly suspicious, on purpose,&nbsp;in hopes of deliberately making&nbsp;her sweat,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I was eventually appeased and convinced by her efforts. It's weird. I&nbsp;don't know the whole story, or anything like it, really, but something significant seems to have changed between these two, it seems like it's good news all around, and I'm sure I will end up hearing about it, whenever it makes sense for me to hear it. Whatever it is, I like it.<br>
<br>I feel like I've handled the situation well. I feel like a&nbsp;weight is lifting off my shoulders. I see the both of these two being considerate, being mindful, and accounting for themselves, and I know beyond any doubt that I have contributed hugely to this outcome, which I do not believe would otherwise&nbsp;have ever&nbsp;come about at all. I'm not exactly <em>proud: </em>I know&nbsp;all of this was way&nbsp;out of my hands; I can't look at things that way even if I want to. But I'm definitely very <em>pleased,</em> and I'm very, very&nbsp;happy to have participated to whatever extent I have. <br>
<br>meanwhile: she invited me to smoke k2 nearly the first second she saw me, even despite knowing I was quitting, having already been told as much rather assertively a number of times. I sheepishly accepted&nbsp;-- even abandoned my breakfast at that very moment just to expedite my joining her. <em>Does this mean&nbsp;you changed your mind, you crazy little asshole?</em> No, it doesn't. Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't even mean I am weak: I made a judgment call. I chose to acquiesce and&nbsp;tag along with&nbsp;this girl&nbsp;in order that my further assessment of things could continue uninhibited. I experiment, remember? Fuck the bullshit. I will address these things in real time as they progress: I know that my underlying preference&nbsp;remains to remove myself from&nbsp;all&nbsp;this drugs nonsense and be separate. I know that this preference will be a heavy anchor that guards me. Fuck the bullshit. Nothing will ever hurt me.<br>
<br>I'm glad drugs scare you. Holy <em>shit </em>do I already worry about motherfuckers <em>enough. </em>Drugs are no good. Never do them.<br><br>it's about lunch time for me. Enjoy your retardedly busy day and whatever. Talk soon.<br>

I got kinda <i>humorously tricked </i>into permitting myself to smoke my k2 this morning as a result of my desire to quit in the first place being contingent on <i>reasons </i>I then judged to no longer be relevant. I never got around to correctly integrating as much in my mind, as I had foolishly presumed the issue was already resolved, but, as it turns out, somewhere up there, in that higher spirit faculty entirely separate from my conditional psychopath self, I do have an <i>actual preference </i>that I no longer do drugs, and it isn't at any risk of being manipulated by varying conditions at all. So, big whoop -- I fucked up. But the damage is negligible, it helped put me in touch with the correct approach of my true self I really should've been more considerate of to begin with, and now I am going to do shit the right way, and it isn't even going to be difficult or anything. The end.<br>
<br></div><div>I've got more to say, but I pretty much spent all my internet time working out my own thoughts in writing I then proceeded to scrap. <i>All </i>of it was written to you, too. <i>Thanks. </i>Seriously.<br>

Then I went for a lunch meeting with another lady in the entertainment business so we could network and share in ideas and plan to collaborate. and that we did!! I am very excited! And thanks to her, I'll be participating in a block party in August that I knew nothing about before today. Then I went to bank. posted business flyers on the bulletin board. went to walmart for food, and the makings for goody bags to hand out at events.

handed to me. And my boss very kindly let me know I should have brought someone in by now. Big oops. I think there is disappointment there. I'm putting effort into promoting it now. But at the same time, I don't know if I'll be able to get people in. I'm not a sales person. And the facials are a bit pricier than most other places, so it's very difficult to find people who can afford it. So really now, I don't know how I feel about it. I'm hoping all goes well.

Not sure if I should say anything back. Maybe it'll take me a month to be inspired to say the perfectly right thing in response. I just don't know if it would be worth either of our time for me to say anything back. It only would be if a friendship were salvageable. Or eh, maybe that's not true. Maybe saying something back on another hand would bring further closure to the situation. I just feel awkward about it at the moment. Because I'm sure what I said to him that day still probably really stings him now. I don't want to open a door that just ends up with me rubbing it in all over again. He's a
good person. That I know. And I guess since I already conveyed that in my text over a month ago, maybe that's where I should leave it. It's simple, and it's there.

Just wondering. (I saw something on the day planner, what's up.)<br><br>I will tell you a secret. Partners acting illegitimately toward one another and partners acting rightly complementary toward one another, really, are almost nothing alike. I can even point out <em>proof </em>you&nbsp;<em>already have</em>&nbsp;in your possession, so that you may understand: you know that the nature of a correct coupling is more readily inferred even from its <em>absence </em>than it is from the nature of&nbsp;a wrong relationship, don't you? Don't you? I know you do, so <em>nyah.</em> This is something of a sacred topic&nbsp;for me, you see. I will argue with you about this <em>all day.</em> Why? Because men and women are so incredibly <em>perfect </em>for each other, and you should stop fretting and taking yourself seriously at <em>once,</em> that's why, you dreadfully silly person. Slap slap slap. In fact, I&nbsp;refuse to believe you have even <em>seen </em>a data point that is relevant to this subject at <em>all </em>-- except perhaps in your relationship with your father, which, if I may say so, dear,&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;rather&nbsp;strong and healthy, and for which you are very fortunate. But beyond that? <em>Nothing!</em> You are <em>blind.</em> Don't hate, either, buddy, friend. Don't even <em>think</em> about it. I'm <em>allowed </em>to tell you this. <br>
<br>what are you even complaining about, anyway? You have it easy. A woman is made&nbsp;complete by receiving and accepting the&nbsp;<em>total offering</em> of the&nbsp;<em>whole man's self,</em> you see. <em>Easy.</em> And <em>all throughout,</em> she&nbsp;must do&nbsp;<em>so little</em> beyond <em>letting</em> the motherfucker&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;it! But a man? Get this -- he is only made complete by <em>giving himself entirely,</em> and then&nbsp;<em>presenting </em>the resultant&nbsp;<em>perfected woman</em> to himself! And he has to <em>bust </em>his <em>ass </em>the <em>whole time!</em>&nbsp; <br>
<br>::imagines gears moving::<br><br>::salaciously licks his vampire lips::<br><br>p.s., I vote <em>don't worry</em> about getting back to the guy, by the way. Even a month later, for that matter. He doesn't need to be babied -- he needs to acclimate and develop a tolerance to your woman's tendency to heartlessly introduce distance when issues involving men are difficult. He needs to practice knowing your woman's mind without relying on your accurate feedback, so that, when something happens, he is not rattled from his place and tempted to act unbecomingly. I mean, really: how else is he going to love you despite yourself? And how else are you going to <em>believe</em> him when he <em>tells</em> you? You silly human beings, you.<br>

Weight off my shoulders. It's gonna be awkward when I have to go in there for whatever reason, but ah well. 30 more days and I'm home free. There aren't any more facials scheduled for me. There was only one lined up, but it falls outside of 30 days. I'm still on call for the next month, but I'm sure it'll go by quickly. For me to be on call not getting payed, to sit around just in case someone calls.. it's pretty silly. I can't keep doing that. If someone else is going to control part of my schedule, I have to get paid for that part of my schedule. It was making me so incredibly restless.</div><div>&nbsp;The kicker for me was the classes planned for today and yesterday. I was told a month ago we would be
doing the classes, and to mark these days off on my calendar. I wasn't told until Thursday that the classes are in Jersey and that I would be paying for half of them. That really should be said up front so that I could make the decision. So I felt that wasn't very considerate, and since I already had gut feelings telling me things weren't right there, I didn't see it fit to have me and the owner invest any more in my employment there.</div><div>I gave my notice over the phone, and then by an email to confirm. I was a hot mess for a few hours. Got so anxious that my hands went all tingly like they had fallen asleep. It was the right decision. Glad I got it over with on that day. I wouldn't have gotten it over with right away if my dad hadn't given me a reality check.</div><div><br></div><div>Now I just need to figure out what I am going to do for another income source. I have several ideas, I just need to figure out which idea to commit to pursuing. Some
involve working for other people. Some involve doing everything on my own. I'll have to do some brainstorming and write things out.</div><div><br></div><div>I was frustrated to find out that I can't offer at-home facials to people through my business. Bleck. Damn Pennsylvania laws. You have to be an employee of a salon. No independent contractors allowed. That's messed up. Information that would have been useful to me before I spent all that time and money on schooling because that was basically the whole dang point! So now I have a long term goal to get my own mini Esthetics Spa licensed, so that I can indeed offer all traveling services that are convenient for people. I think it will be a real hit. I'm already drawing up pictures of my future house with my wittle mini spa and body art business attached to it. Hehehe :-) &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Today is my crush's birthday. Fact! Ok, other topic.</div><div><br></div><div>I was in a really
crappy mood the first half of the day yesterday. Face painting for free and being disappointed with how little promotion I got out of it. But I entirely blame my mood. I wasn't in the right mindset, and I feel bad that I wasn't acting happier to be there. lol. poo! Plus the cold rain. yick. Chills me and drains me right to the bone. So I took a two hour nap when I got home. and then I spent the evening with my darling Panda who I have not seen in a year. That made me feel ten thousand times better. My heart was filled with rainbow lights. And I was prettymuch red-faced with tears streaking down my cheeks all evening from nonstop laughter. I loves her, and I missed her terribly. She's the one I mentioned way back when that I was being all affectionate with and accidentally led on and then I felt like shit about it. Mneh. So happy to be reunited. As soon as the weather is wonderfully nice, I'll visit her in Maryland and we'll sit on the rocks by the river
all day. Her and our friend Andrew who plays guitar and sings for us while we hunt for pretty little stones and feed each other pretzels and silly things like that. It will be wonderful. But anyways. I covered her feetsies in henna yesterday.</div><div><br></div><div>I haven't figured out yet what I am going to do today. Beyond shower and put away laundry. We shall see!</div><div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">Talk to you later friend.

Been hanging around the same people some, mostly just for something to do, and even to the extent that I'll pass their lit blunts back and forth between them with my own hands, but I am done. I feel good about it.<br>
<br>it is completely your business, by the way. One thing you will come to know about me is that I do not believe at all in the typical distinctions between mine and another's business. Or that, more specifically, while I do believe in the legitimacy of <i>some </i>personal boundaries, I do not believe, as many do, that boundaries are deemed legitimate <i>solely </i>on the merit of their being <i>personal. </i>Sometimes these boundaries are even <i>liabilities </i>-- as would be the case, for instance, if I were unwilling even to hear a word against my drug use. I would be made deaf to your encouragement by my boundaries. Do you understand?<br>
<br>I've been busy. Am still busy, really. Shepherding my flock and tending to my lost sheep. I have a lunch date with a recent new friend I've been keeping an eye on, and someone else sitting directly in front of me, right now, actually, who is getting antsy, and to whom I have committed what time I have remaining before I even meet up with my date. I'm sure I will be very pleased to tell you, in great detail, all about these things -- but first I need to find a break from all this intensive counseling and crazy babysitting!<br>
<br>I recently acquired my third laptop for free, so now I have a laptop again, because I guess I'm just that awesome. Or fortunate, at least -- I would be lying if I said I acquired it solely on the merit of my awesomeness. In any case, I'm around, and my internet access is no longer the burden it previously was, so, when I am able to get around to it, you will definitely hear from me. Hopefully sooner than later, but ehh. I can't complain. I must confess I kinda love the shit out of whatever it is I am doing.<br>
<br>hope you are well. And a good morning to you. Talk to you when I talk to you.<br><br>&lt;3<br>

She is the same one I mentioned meeting for a lunch date in my earlier email. She's much younger than I am, she's almost overbearingly hyperactive, and, really, we have almost nothing in common at all, but, as usual, I love the shit out of her, as she has this rather open, interested kind of personality that leaves me a bit of wiggle room with which I'm able to do it. Meanwhile, she's in a committed relationship already, albeit a long-distance one. She has much invested in this relationship, and it is important to her, so I know that, while I love her, and even <i>because </i>I love her, I can not pursue her. I just can't.</div>
<div><br></div><div>as you might expect, it's this silly and complicated thing. I initially took to her under the pretext of my showing her around, helping to protect her from vultures: it's dangerous out here, you see, and she is vulnerable. I wasted no time in appointing myself her stand-in husband, using our closeness as a sort of tool to ward off the advances of more unscrupulous men and otherwise keep her from harm. She drags me all around the city. Things I wouldn't ordinarily do, she makes me do. After spending my nearly every available minute with her since first running into her, though, I must admit: my heart aches for her. She's not even my type, and the shit doesn't even make <i>sense, </i>but oh, I ache. I tell her she owes me nothing, and I certainly don't want to complicate her life, but ugh. I just <i>want. </i>I want to be united to her in this desperately wistful and longing way that is utterly nonspecific beyond its simply including fewer prohibitive factors and <i>more, more, more. </i>I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. But I suppose these matters will be resolved sooner than later, as she's only just passing temporarily through the area, seeking to meet up with her dude as soon as she is able and eventually continue on with her life. I even imagine things are better this way. But <i>oof. </i>My heart.</div>
<div><br></div><div>still off the fancy drugs. Everyone around me remains surprised and is left unable to ignore the issue as I continue dealing with them and seeing them around. Interestingly, by this dynamic, the subject of quitting drugs and attaining to a position of better psychological health has become an active point of dialog, being snuck very conveniently right in the faces of many -- partially inadvertently, for that matter, but also partially by my own design. I like things this way, too. It compliments how I act toward others; it is complimentary to what role I prefer I play in the lives of others. It's just good all around.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I could probably share more -- there is always more. But I think I have a lunch date. <i>Grumble, grumble. </i>I kid.</div><div><br></div><div>see you!</div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>artismyjoy333@yahoo.com </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Fri, Apr 4, 2014 at 12:30 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>Love bites don't it?

I nevertheless went over it from many different angles in my mind throughout the week, even walking uptown toward the Pillar a number of times in efforts to rehearse the encounter in my imagination. I was just there for the first time pretty recently -- I'm not sure if I mentioned, but I discovered I was totally unable to taste the flavor of hookah due to my having no sense of smell, and it was this interesting and mildly noteworthy little thing. In any case, I was completely sure I knew exactly where the place was, but even after my repeated attempts, I walked right past it, a few mornings in a row, and I couldn't even find it. I <i>knew </i>where it was, I felt like a freakin' <i>idiot </i>about it, and I even considered looking it up on the internet, like a tourist, which probably would've been my next step, but that's about as far as I got. My pursuit ended up being diverted entirely by my running into this girl I mentioned -- who actually, coincidentally, dragged me straight to the Pillar the first day I met her, in the course of her hyperactively bouncing me all over the city. And she's a tourist! She doesn't know the city at all!<br>
<br>but no. I decided against it. I definitely did want to do it in some sense, but I couldn't do it, just like I can't pursue this girl. I knew you would be working, too -- to be fair, I'm kinda curious to see what that's all about, for sure, but I figured it would just add a further degree of complication to something that very well could've already been a complicated and delicate thing, and I dunno. Just couldn't work it out in my head.<br>
<br>sure as fuck didn't stop me from trying, though, holy crap. I'll tell you the truth: I was considering making it look like an accident. <i>Why, </i>you evil person, you? Well, because that would've been the simplest and most convenient foot in the door, that's why! Shit, nigga. Do you know how tricky I am? I will tell you. I'm so tricky I <i>purposely cultivated </i>an <i>active </i>inclination toward the Pillar in this poor little girl's <i>mind, </i>and even <i>administrated </i>its level of intensity and priority, <i>deliberately, </i>in order that the resultant behavior of her <i>going </i>there, with <i>me </i>in tow, would line up <i>precisely </i>with your appearance there on a fuckin' <i>clock. </i>Do you think I'm kidding? She only dragged me there the day we met because I had suggestively influenced her to give a shit that they were hiring. Guess what she was ready to do <i>next </i>in her application process, with a snap of my fingers disguised brilliantly as great advice? I am not kidding even a <i>little </i>bit. Would you have believed <i>that </i>was an accident if it happened? It sure as hell would've <i>looked </i>like an accident. She would've <i>told </i>you it was an accident. <i>Fervently, </i>with <i>proof, </i>in complete disregard of your work schedule and your apprehension alike, <i>desperate </i>to <i>believe </i>it was an accident, she would've told you -- while I played the fuck dumb and pretended to have no clue the two of you were invisibly competing with one another and simultaneously doing my bidding. Oh, what a dreadful mishap! <i>Here, </i>my dear. I'm <i>so sorry. </i>Let me save you from this <i>unfortunate </i>ruckus. But pay no attention to the man behind the curtain! Never you mind this incidental demonstration of my clearly preferential treatment toward you, cough cough cough. Hack, hack. And tap dance the fuck out of there on the Pillar's hardwood, I would've -- while your painted children fucking&nbsp;<i>gawked </i>and <i>shat. </i>No lie, dude.&nbsp;<i>All </i>of this, I was completely ready to do. Just as easily as I <i>breathe, </i>I will do this.<br>
<br>why didn't I do it? Is it because the chick dissed me and foiled my plans? Were my evil tricks thwarted at the last second by circumstances beyond my control? You'll never know, will you. I'll tell you what else, too: I would've explained to you my elaborate scheme in complete detail soon after I pulled it off. I would not have left you in the dark by any means. But you'll never know that, either, will you. And <i>still </i>I tell you these things. For some nefarious purpose? <i>You tell me.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>I will explain to you my reasoning. It is simple: I would so much rather have waved my entire fantastic presentation right in your face on purpose as soon as I possibly could've. I mean, how else could I possibly <i>give </i>it to you in all of its <i>meticulous </i>splendor? Do you think I would do these things for my <i>own self? </i>Holy <i>shit </i>no! I won't even take a fucking <i>shower! </i>No, no, no. Art is made for its audience. Art is only made complete by its audience.&nbsp;<i>Pssst! </i>Hey you! Did you think that accidental demonstration of my preferential treatment was my final act, you small-minded little human being? Wink, wink, wink. Behold! How about my <i>purposefully offering </i>this <i>other chickie </i>hapless on a <i>spit, </i>in a gift box, with a fuckin' <i>bow </i>on it, bitch. Ohhhh, it would've been glorious. You have no idea. You truly have <i>no idea.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>instead, though, I just ramble to you like an asshole. Like a narcissist of immeasurable grandiosity, offering no counterbalance at all to his own self-incrimination, I ramble; I fantasize; I bring <i>nothing </i>to the table at <i>all. </i>Why? Is it because my accomplice disappeared and left me out to dry? Is it because my aptitude and my good intentions alike are purely imagined, as could be supposed? <i>Fuck you, </i>lady. I decided against it a week ago. Really, I did. I let myself devise elaborate schemes like this in the meantime because.... why? I don't know. <i>Because I like to? </i>But also because I <i>allow </i>myself to <i>keep </i>liking it and doing it, as I've found my continuing doing it to be helpful. What does it help? Well, it helps me determine if my intentions are <i>imagined </i>or not, of course. I mean, really: how would I know my will is true if I were unable to do its opposite at any time? How would I know its <i>degree </i>of truth, for that matter, were I not able to <i>determine,&nbsp;</i>with <i>absolute precision,&nbsp;</i>the <i>weight </i>of my <i>incentive </i>to do its opposite at any time? Think about it. Do you believe your pen pal is a madman, my dear? Tisk, tisk. He is a <i>scientist. </i>He is an alchemist and a true magician. Abracadabra! Every single thing he does is real.<br>
<br>I thought it best to prod you for signals. For you, I thought it best. Indeed, every step of the way I prodded you for signals. My mentioning her dragging me through the city -- prodding! My giving you a chance to mention your day's schedule -- prodding! Even my moods, my difficulty, my dismay, my foreknowledge of your business -- all of this I intentionally utilized in order that I would do no evil toward you, but could still prod you regardless. I can so, so <i>smell you from here, </i>dude. And it's just.... I don't know what. But I like it. I like it, and I think I am about done babbling about it. I need to head to my lunch.<br>
<br>we reconciled, by the way. Me and her, that is. It's <i>funny, </i>and <i>fawn, fawn, fawn, </i>and fuck it. I am <i>hungry. </i>Can you tell?<br><br>maybe next time. Enjoy your day.<br><br>::tap dances the fuck out::<br>

I sat with him for a little while towards the end of my visit when the rest of the company cleared out. I did have to fight off some tears. That man really loves me and thinks big things of me. The closer to death he gets, he's less about him and more about me when he
talks to me, which I'm not used to. It's usually a one-way conversation with no connection whatsoever that goes on for hours with me trying to find a reason to get up and go do something else. Today he was zoning in on who I am and what my hopes and dreams are and what little bits of wisdom he could leave with me. I'm connecting more with him. I actually enjoyed sitting around and taking in what he had to say. It's been easy to connect with him.

But then I might feel guilty when people expecting me asked why I didn't go. I don't want to drive to the city tonight and freak trying to figure out where to park and then walk through the cold in the dark to this packed club, pay $5 to get in and most likely have an awkward time of it and be tired by 11.

I might just be an asshole and stay home. My bellydance teacher is performing there tonight. And I'm sure I'd bump into friends. But I don't want to take the risk of having
an uncomfortable night. I really have to be pumped up to go out in a crowd. and I'm just not feeling it. sigh. I'll probably take a shower to get rid of the rotten firewood smell and then think about arriving late. That way I am showing good intentions. If anyone should text me by then asking why the heck I'm not there yet, I might go. Or I might tell them I am not feeling well and then go sleeps. I am so not a wild child. At least not in that way.

I remember I was kinda wondering, like, two months ago, whether your business contact number was your actual phone number. I think it popped up in my head before I even had a phone. I'm a retard. But <i>hey, thanks! </i>&nbsp;:D<i><br>
</i><br>yeah, I dunno dude. I mean, I'm wacked out; there's no denying I'm pretty wacked out. But I can't do shit like that. I don't know why I even assert as much in my speech, really -- I swear, half the time, it's just habitual methods of communicating I've picked up and streamlined for the purpose of maintaining coherent dialog without my allocating any further resources to worrying about the details of whatever the fuck I'm doing. It's silly. People accuse me of overanalyzing, too. People accuse me of thinking too hard, presumably on the basis of my shit sounding complicated. I'm just like, <i>pssshh.&nbsp;</i>Fuck out of here. I am autopilot mode. I am <i>sleeping. </i>Sometimes I can't even tell the difference. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Blah blah blah. <i>I apologize. </i>Mumble mumble.<br>
<br>I'm glad you have opportunity to appreciate your grandfather and broaden your relationship, and I'm glad he has opportunity to do the same with you. To me, this connectivity, this love, this acceptance that transcends apprehension, is among some of the most valuable content to even be gleaned from being alive. I mean, it's sad to lose somebody; it sucks to suffer a discomfort in any sense -- I don't mean to devalue that. Simultaneously, though, feel like these types of experiences are most correctly perceived not as losses, but as gains, and from within the context of how successfully they facilitate this right approach to <i>life, </i>this right approach to other <i>people, </i>this <i>true revelation </i>of the <i>soul </i>type shit I could never describe even by my most eloquent of explanations. Seriously, man. Why the fuck do you think I'm retired? Why do you think I gave up on eating aimlessly from the buffet? I am <i>decided. </i>I <i>know </i>what is good. I am <i>done. </i>Gimme that fuckin' plate. Mumble mumble.<br>
<br>I'm at my brother's. I'm having a decent little evening. Not bad at all. I could write a lot of things, and I think it would even be really cool if I did, but my head has been floating so wildly from place to place all throughout the course of my writing this letter, which I would swear has already taken me hours. I think it must be the coffee. Maybe the coffee in addition to my having not eaten -- I left my dinner tray just sitting somewhere and took off when I saw this chick with the other dude at my free meal earlier today. <i>Ohhh, </i>my heart. I hate it. I don't know how I'm even going to deal with continuing to see her around.<br>
<br>I had this funny little thing tonight where I was sitting in the city with my brother, debriefing him on all sorts of things I've been doing in the past week or whatever. I forget what I was saying to him exactly, but there came a point where I mentioned this lady friend of mine, and I only introduced the subject in relation to the horrifying feeling I'll get recently from our accidentally seeing each other on the street. Right in the middle of this exact description, though, and for the first time since my leaving the dinner, I see her and the dude directly in my line of sight across the street, themselves having each only just noticed I was there. I about lost my shit right there on the sidewalk, man. Straight hid under my hood, covered up with my hands, shaking my head back and forth in absolute and overwhelming bafflement, squirming in my seat like a snake, just <i>laughing. </i>Clearly audible from across the street.&nbsp;Not even the type of laughing you do when some shit is simply&nbsp;<i>funny, </i>either -- I'm talking about the other kind, where, like, emotions are just coming out beyond your control, and some corresponding physical expression is involuntarily paired with it, and it could just as easily be crying, or yelling, or making unintelligible noises. That was me. I mean, it was funny. I don't mean to embellish it; I definitely laughed because it was funny. <i>Did that seriously just happen? Are we fucking for real right now?&nbsp;</i>But damn, dude. That was some crazy shit for a minute there.<br>
<br>I considered sending her as my <i>emissary, </i>too, btw. That is, alone. Without me. Even intending she have no understanding of what she was doing there, but meanwhile, engineering your recognizing her and reacting by your own piecing together of my intentional descriptions. Would that have been better, I wonder? I'm sure you would never in a million years have suspected <i>that </i>accident. I'll probably be thinking stupid shit like this all night until it segues me straight into a dream sleep. Hopefully it's a good one.<br>
<br>speaking of which. I got lost. I need to find something to eat and lay the fuck down.<br><br>you're awesome.<br><br></div>

I had this little window of time in my early afternoon, you see, between my having briefly made nice with Nicky before she left for the day, that morning, and her eventually confirming to me by her behavior the status of our relationship,&nbsp;closer to my dinner time,&nbsp;upon her reentering into the proximity of both myself&nbsp;and her new make-believe husband when she was finally to return to the area. This window of time was quite stressful for me, having included on an almost involuntary basis my obsessively keeping tabs from afar on the dude aforementioned, scanning his conduct continually and rigorously for even the most subtle of indications he had reason to anticipate Nicky doing something I would not be told. It was <i>very maddening, </i>as I'm sure I have conveyed, so, when Amir pressured me away from the area to accompany him in his panhandling for his next bag of k2, I eventually broke down and resigned to make use of a little bonding time with my street bro, hoping to clear my poor and preoccupied little head. And away we went.<br>
<br>it's funny. Amir, of course, ever the psychopath himself, saw my sorry state on his predator's radar <i>right away, </i>and without my even saying <i>anything </i>about it, besides. I'm only just realizing this as I start to type it, but he probably noticed, actually, before we even said a <i>thing </i>to each other, having observed my attention span, from a distance,&nbsp;<i>just </i>like I was observing the other guy's at the same time, and, <i>dammit, dude,&nbsp;</i>this is probably even the <i>reason </i>he was so insistent on having me hang out in the first fuckin' place, too. Ugh. I am suddenly rather touched. This fuckface surprises me all the time. Fuckin' asshole. He is a real bro, straight up. What the fuck.<br>
<br>so yeah. Case in point, our interaction begins almost immediately with his cruelly and pointedly taunting me about how he likes my girl, she's cute, and he's got her in his sights. Says she's gonna be his next trophy. He's gonna trick her out; he's gonna give her what she likes; he's gonna fuck her until her head's <i>all </i>confused; she's not gonna know <i>what </i>to do with herself, oh man. Says it's going to be easy and she's going to ask for it. Asks me what drugs she does with a casual little chuckle. Asks me what the fuck I'm gonna do, chump. <i>What, she's single, right? You ain't fuckin' her, right? She's looking for a man, right? What's the problem then? </i>Staring each other ferociously the fuck down with eyes locked, both of us immutably territorial and elder wolves. Him unloading his <i>whole clip </i>right into my heart with a truly <i>maniacal </i>and rapacious <i>bloodlust, </i>no differently at <i>all </i>from the&nbsp;<i>murderous glee </i>you would expect from a vampire in the most superfluously graphic of imaginable anime. Me, meanwhile, taking all of his hits&nbsp;like a good little soldier of peace. <i>Anticipating </i>them. Making sure they go <i>right </i>where they belong and do <i>exactly </i>what they're supposed to do. Taking them&nbsp;like <i>nothing</i><i>&nbsp;</i>-- ready&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>kill; </i>ready to tear the <i>literal </i>soul from his flesh merely by the <i>strength </i>of my <i>forbearance; </i>outmatching the confidence of his patronizing expression <i>effortlessly </i>in my unwavering and professional silence. <i>Shaming&nbsp;</i>him <i>totally </i>by my knowing;&nbsp;<i>wholly incriminating </i>his attacks. From the top of the tallest mountain I prepare to flatten him as he arrogantly braces his sniper rifle and readies his killing blow. I see it coming in his eyes. <i>What's the problem then? </i>Ridicule dripping from his tongue. <i>You LOVE her? You in LOVE with that girl? </i>Scoffing at me. <i>Scoffing, </i>as if to say: that <i>peon! </i>How the fuck <i>dare </i>you! <i>Certain </i>of his victory; certain of his <i>implied superiority </i>over me; certain of my implied defeat. Imagining those gears turning. Salaciously licking his vampire lips. Ohhh, my heart.<br>
<br>I don't <i>have </i>gears, you bitch, you dog. You <i>crack slave, </i>you <i>drug puppet motherfucker. </i>That's just the disguise you predictable little assholes eat right out of my hand -- the disguise I feed you on purpose knowing your only frame of reference is your tiny little domino set self. <i>Slap, slap, slap, </i>you weak whorehouse of cards. I am a <i>werewolf. </i>I am <i>Cerberus, </i>great&nbsp;lupine keyholder of the abyss. <i>I own you. </i>You will <i>beg </i>me not to huff and puff. Of <i>course </i>I love her, you dreadfully silly person. Three or four short days of knowing her while she cut off my cock the whole time and shamed me -- <i>of course </i>I'd take a knife in the heart for her. Just like I take your knife in my heart right the fuck <i>now, </i>there, <i>big bro. </i>On <i>purpose.&nbsp;</i>Oh, you're panhandling? For drugs? I've got <i>money </i>in my pocket, with a casual little chuckle. What the fuck are <i>you </i>gonna do, chump. I love <i>you. </i>Wink, wink.&nbsp;Game, set, <i>match, </i>motherfucker. Cross my vampire legs. Light a victory cigarette, all shivering and blissed the fuck out. That's right, buddy. You will do <i>nothing.&nbsp;<br>
</i><br>he did beg me not to huff and puff. Quite literally, he did. He gave up. He sat down at the edge of my table and trusted me to feed him, admitting earnestly that I had the right approach as I explained to him in great depth the legitimacy of my ways -- even telling me in words that he's looking for somebody like me to help him, because he knows he is evil as fuck, and he knows that nobody else is on his level. We parted ways amicably when he acquired his k2. He wanted me to stick around, and for what reason, I may never know -- but I had a dinner to catch. And catch the dinner I did.<br>
<br>I miss my introvert time. My sitting the fuck around without worrying what threats and disruptions I must inevitably address as I struggle to manage my mind in lieu of living outside on the street with so little I can even convince myself is a reprieve. I would never have been able to tell this awesome story had I not woken up in a quiet little room with my brother asleep and my mind at peace. I'm glad I did though. This was some classic shit. I'm glad I got to share it with you.<br>
<br>I need to go to church. Yeah, church. That's why I'm here, actually. Right now, I am going. See you.<br><br></div>

How <i>much </i>like that? Well, it's not really important. I imagine I am much more particular about the correct representation of small and pedantic nuances than you are -- we would essentially be referencing the same things by different manners of descriptions. It's not something I would care to contradict you about, though maybe we will talk about it if you like. I appreciate your being open about it toward me in the meantime.<br>
<br>one thing I <i>know, </i>however, and <i>must </i>tell you, is that fucking with <i>energies, </i>identifying yourself by them, and developing <i>any </i>degree of receptivity to them, even including the trusting of your own interpretation of their nature or their function, can be&nbsp;<i>very, very </i>dangerous, and necessarily <i>is </i>very dangerous, in <i>no </i>uncertain terms at all, in the case that you are not under the spiritual protection of the Lord.<br>
<br>now, I don't mean to preach your ear off -- you know me. I know what bitches <i>like. </i>I'm not going to complicate our dealings by bombarding you against your will with some spiel you didn't ask for, and particularly not without first laying down some groundwork with which to help you digest it and keep from stumbling over it. I'm not. But for <i>reference, </i>so, when I say these things, you <i>know, </i>the spiritual protection of the Lord is a strictly Christian thing. You have to agree to follow Christ in order to have it -- after which, sometimes <i>immediately, </i>and sometimes by a <i>process, </i>you are granted the indwelling of the one God's Spirit, by which your <i>own mind </i>comes to include a new, extrasensorial, and <i>wholly spiritual </i>dimension through which the Lord's love may be experienced directly, his will may be known to you, and his discernment of truth, in knowledge of his will and by his love, may be exercised. These are the elements of which the Lord's spiritual protection are composed.<br>
<br>now, chill. I <i>know </i>this is heavy. I'm sorry. I'm not telling you: <i>fuck you! Believe me! </i>I'm not. But please hear me: it is only by this very real phenomenon that I am able to be conscientious, and <i>love, </i>and resist my own psychopathic will at all. It is only by my being indwelt directly by God himself that Armando and I are not the same. Truly, I would not lie. And that's that. We're gravy. I'm done. Do you.<br>
<br>I'll tell you something else, though. I talk about magic a lot. I <i>do </i>fuck with energies. I command demons. <i>Lots </i>of them. Sometimes I don't <i>even </i>command them; I just <i>chit chat </i>with them; I <i>relate </i>to them! We're <i>buddies! </i>We have invisible little conversations in plain sight of men,&nbsp;<i>all the time, </i>with simultaneous and alternate meanings laced intentionally throughout. Keeping attention away from ourselves; keeping men in the dark completely. Meanwhile, just bullshitting about <i>mysteries, </i>fucking <i>crazy shit </i>you guys don't even know how to deal with. Things <i>we </i>know, but common people <i>don't </i>know. Inside jokes. Lots of them. I am not kidding: I have done this deliberately and on a regular basis for many years. The Lord is ready to extend an <i>incredible </i>amount of liberty to those in right guidance with whom that liberty may be trusted.<br>
<br>what people know as magic is essentially the affectation of reality by way of willpower. <i>Pure creation. </i>Lots of things are magic. <i>Art </i>is magic. But all things are the Lord's, and neither our wisdom nor our goodness may compare to the Lord's. Many things have their place, and there is little which is evil purely of itself, but all things are best done according to the discretion of the Lord, and seeking to exercise elements of the Lord's power without also being conformed by the discretion of the Lord is a very dangerous thing. It has the capacity to go very wrong and to facilitate an enormous amount of evil. There's a right way to do things, and it's meant to work out very well for all involved, but, because of what people choose to do, things are instead very complicated. Too complicated for me to bombard you with, really, at least at this present juncture they are. I will leave you with what I hope has been a graceful and unobtrusive overview in the meantime.<br>
<br>don't hate.<br><br>:)<br><br></div>

I've always wanted to be a living juxtaposition. I've always been different, and pursued whatever everybody else around me wasn't doing or being. I guess that is my label. Different. And maybe that's pretty snobbish, to just want to fit in my own category and nobody else's. As if I were something extra special. Something so exclusive and rare and extraordinary and misunderstood. Something you put in the miscellaneous section when you're organizing. I take pride in not being like the others. That does sound snobbish. Look at me go. Elite alien girl too special to mesh with the others. Too many things all in one package to put an accurate label on. Yeah. That is snobbish. Is that snobbish? It sure sounds snobbish.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">Oh my, I don't have much else to follow that with for now.

I barely ever go. I like one in particular, right now, but even still, lots of things about it are weird. I consider it my error, in some cases, that I am not more welcoming of some of what it encompasses, and so I try to correct my error, even if I simultaneously continue to have objections. To some extent, I just make myself go with the intention of immersing myself forcefully, even <i>desensitizing </i>myself to my objections. It's a weird little thing -- I doubt it will make sense to you. I'm not sure it even makes sense to me.<br>
<br>I think most supposed Christians are full of shit, too -- just like I think most people are full of shit no matter where they're coming from. I simultaneously have found that there is a right approach which I do not find inconsistent or problematic in the least -- though, like you, I am first inclined to do things my own way, only. To be fair, I imagine I have seen a much greater sampling of my own evil than you have of yours. I'm older than you. I've had time to get sick of my own bullshit.<br>
<br>I'm not just pleased because you're open toward me, although I admit that is also pleasing. I'm more pleased because I suspect the things we disagree about are trivial and are easily able to be reconciled. Even to the extent that I am in no rush at all to argue about them. In fact, I bet you're already feeling like you're silly and unsubstantiated in a few little ways after trying to frame some of these things and run them by me, without my even having to say shit about them -- and if you aren't, you sure might, after you sleep. But you will hate me for being right about this and I probably should've just pretended I had no idea. Oops.<br>
<br>can you tell I am smiling? I'm sorry if I pushed any buttons. Or too many buttons. But I didn't.<br><br></div>
