Feel all sore in my throat and the inside of my mouth for some reason, to the point that eating is unpleasant. I treated myself to Subway, a few hours ago, but my actually consuming it was something of a chore, and I kinda feel like I wasted it. On the other hand, the employee made my sandwich very nicely. It was tasty; it was just a pain in my ass on top of that.<br>
<br>I will probably be going to sleep imminently, as my brother has already laid himself down for the night and it's all dark and quiet in here anyway. I am fatigued, myself, but I'm more just going to bed for lack of something better to do. I am considering leaving here tomorrow without my being commanded to do it. If I do, it will probably be the first time I've even done so since I've been homeless.<br>
<br>still don't have a job. I admit it: I'm taking my sweet time because I want you to go fuck the milkman. Or whatever else it is you said.<br><br>hope your busy day has been manageable and pleasant. I have no idea what you've been doing -- I actually scanned through older emails at one point looking for clues and hints, but to no avail. You can feel free to tell me about it if you want. I might wake up if you email me hard enough. Though I won't guarantee anything, because my phone's email notifications seem to be pretty unreliable except in the case my phone has already been active recently. Plus I might just ignore you in favor of my more engaging business, since I'm just that kind of dude.<br>
<br>sleep well, etc.<br><br><br>

<p dir=ltr>There are big cultural and religious differences that could quite possibly keep it to just a friendship. I mean, i don't mind the differences at all. What an amazing friendship I think this will be.</p>

I feel so ugh. I wish I could sit around writing you emails forever.<br>
<br>
pretty sure my friend Justin dissed me earlier as we were hanging out<br>
because he needed me to leave so my gay prowler would give him a<br>
blowjob. That was pretty interesting -- they both insisted I leave<br>
under the pretext I had been disrespectful and caused some kind of<br>
problems, but I have no idea what they were talking about and I didn't<br>
notice any problems. I have no idea what the fuck happened, really. I<br>
haven't told anyone about it because I don't even know what happened.<br>
I am thinking of telling them both to fuck themselves next time I hear<br>
from them. I don't know.<br>
<br>
I had the thought randomly maybe a day or two ago: what if you had<br>
been decieving me with a false identity since I first started talking<br>
to you, and all this not meeting and no further contact business was<br>
just to keep me distracted so I wouldn't notice any further<br>
discrepancy? I laughed a little when this thought occurred to me, and<br>
I knew I had to share it with you. (You would never fool me in a<br>
hundred million years, for the record.)<br>
<br>
okay, well. I guess I'm heading to my dinner. Be well n' shit. Hope<br>
you are having a good time with whatever it is you are doing.<br>

I don't know. FML.</p>
<p>don't get me wrong -- something did happen to me. My heart aches. I am slighted. Blah blah blah. But it's whatever, really. I mean, it's small potatoes. You do what you do. You do what you want. My miracle was not cancelled. What else can I even say?</p>
<p>I should probably stop typing this crap so I can quit talking to you like this. And so I can get up and avoid these motherfuckers banging on a piano behind me and some homeless assholes trying to talk to me on my right and my left. Nyeh.</p>

<br>
don't worry, I'm not going to go hunt down your car or anything. (Why<br>
the fuck would I be paying attention to cars passing.)<br>
<br>
so I was having a really crappy day yesterday. I was already talking<br>
to my brother because he was texting me about some shit, blah blah<br>
blah, and, in response to my pleas and my crappy day, I guess he<br>
reached out and asked some friend of ours to harbor me, and the friend<br>
accepted. So, since yesterday evening, I've been tagging along with<br>
this friend, and I've been doing whatever he's been doing, and I slept<br>
at his house. And I guess until something changes I'm allowed to stay<br>
here at his house. In Mountville.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to, like, be positive, see where it goes, shit like that. I<br>
don't know. I''m trying not to be an asshole and be the reason this<br>
arrangement doesn't work. But I already know this dude is super<br>
unstable. He is the real life version of the narcissist I was accused<br>
of being. His whole life is something of a desperate scramble to<br>
maneuver others into regarding him as though he is this or that, and<br>
he is not psychologically competent, so his expectations diverge<br>
impossibly wildly from reality, and his methods of approaching others<br>
are more or less limited to, I dunno, coersion, dramatic pathology,<br>
preying on the very weak, and shit like that. He is someone whose<br>
company I have always had trouble dealing with for longer than maybe<br>
hours at a time, and I literally have to alpha dog him and ensure he<br>
behaves, myself, every time I'm with him, just to keep the surrounding<br>
social environment from becoming a circus in honor of his games. I am<br>
nowhere near any of my resources, and I already ran out of food stamps<br>
this month. The last thing I want to do in my life is end up dependent<br>
in any way on this type of person -- this type of person whose own<br>
needs will guarantee he abuses that dependency enormously. But I don't<br>
know. Maybe if I can get some shit done, for, like, just one fucking<br>
second, while I'm here, it will be worth it. I am trying.<br>

There is no internet here, so I am stuck using my crap phone and<br>
spending all my minutes just to access the internet.<br>
<br>
my host is an alcoholic, because he can't solicit a sufficient amount<br>
of narcissistic resources from his lifestyle and he is miserable. The<br>
house was full of social drinkers cycling in and out yesterday, and it<br>
will probably be the same today. I am an introvert. If I can't attain<br>
to some manner of peace of mind and apt mental functioning while I am<br>
here, I will end up having to leave very soon, and I will be no better<br>
off here than I am on the street. Indeed, this is most likely the<br>
whole entire reason I am kept from better addressing my homelessness<br>
from the street to begin with. It's kinda hard when my own head is<br>
practically inaccessible the whole entire fucking time.<br>
<br>
my brother shuffled me here because he doesn't want to deal with me.<br>
He has convinced himself that my failure to get off the street is a<br>
result of either my own deliberately being uncooperative, or my mental<br>
problems I refuse to treat appropriately with pills, or my just being<br>
a shit human who belongs on the street because of blah blah blah. The<br>
story changes depending on how he is most efficiently reasoned into<br>
doing nothing. Most absurdly to me is that his ''helping'' is only<br>
inconvenient to himself under the condition he believes I should be<br>
handled differently already -- he asserts his letting me in his room<br>
is counterproductive and hurting me where I could otherwise be cured<br>
by some magical alternate treatment of some kind. Motherfucker doesn't<br>
understand my shit will be just the fuck fine the instant it isn't<br>
actively being disrupted by huge problems: he would rather believe<br>
that he is indispensible and that the bullshit in his own head means<br>
something, even at the cost of his brother's life, apparently. He is<br>
by far the shittiest part of my visits to that room.<br>

<p>when I first came here, I spent half the day zipping around and doing social things I really didn't care to be doing, as I was already on edge earlier in the day and just wanted to be left alone -- it was not very pleasant, and neither was my mood very pleasant. I remained on edge. Since then, though, and since around the time I last emailed you, I've chilled out, and so too has my experience chilled out. </p>
<p>I get along with this dude. He's a character, and I really didn't exaggerate that character, but he also has his own predator's radar, and, as such, it doesn't take him much to discern what approach is appropriate to his environment and what is not. I like this about him. I like people whose behavior is sensible, even if that behavior does trend toward the erratic or the difficult, because there is always the possibility of improving that behavior by introducing it to better intel so long as that intel will be integrated sensibly. This is my secret to managing others when need be. This is my secret, even, to managing my own self. Information is everything. </p>
<p>I've dealt with this guy in other kinds of circumstances. In those circumstances, different factors would incline him toward different sorts of incentives, and juggling those factors in order to compel him away from being disruptive has always proven to be rather intensive and strenuous work. This is the work I expected would be required of me upon opting to be here. But his being in his house, with a roommate whose presence has the capacity to affect his own days and his own peace, has proven to be a completely different manner of circumstance. I do what he likes. I pay attention to him, I tend to his moods, and I grant him breaks from his own self. In response, he need not go to any further lengths than mere friendliness in his efforts to preserve what he likes. Thus, it's good. We get along.</p>
<p>we've known each other since I used to run my website back in the day. We have a history of having bonded some over the latest fucked up video or internet trend or whatever. Today he tells me ISIS in Syria just released some propaganda video of their beheading an American journalist, and invites me to watch it with him. I mean, I don't go looking for shit like this, and I've seen more than enough of it already, really. I used to have animal torture videos sent to my email address by the actual torturers, for fuck's sake. I used to reject them when they weren't unique enough! But either way, a beheading video coming up in conversation is pretty casual stuff to me. So we watch it. Couple hours ago, we watched it. Yawn. Day goes on. Whatever.</p>
<p>just now, I hear him watching some shit on his phone next to me. Noises of a baby playing and trying to speak coming out of his phone speakers. I joke in complete deadpan: oh, what's that? Another beheading video? Like I'm interested. Like I'm interested because it's a baby. Immediately after the words leave my mouth, though, and much to my horror, I realize he's watching a video his ex sent to him of his own son talking into the camera and saying hi to his daddy and shit. We both look at each other with eyes wide as fuck for a second. Horror, horror, horror. Then, crack up laughing hysterically. Uncontrollable laughter. Still laughing. We get along.</p>
<p>a weird proposition has arisen since I've come here. This guy is inviting me to tag along with him to Florida. Apparently he just recently determined he would leave PA and go do blah blah blah down there, and he's since gotten it into his head that my accompanying him will be a good idea. He's bugging me a lot about it. He's trying to hook me up with resources that will help make my homelessness more manageable if I am to go there. I don't know how I feel about it. I mean, I hate Florida. Especially south Florida, where he is going. But I feel weird having it thrown in my lap. I don't want to go unless the Lord explicitly calls me to go. But if the Lord does call me to go, I know I do want to go. I don't know, dude. I considered flipping a coin, and using predetermined conditions to interpret God's judgment from the outcome of a series of coin flips, but, no joke, I am a thorough motherfucker, and I already had another series of coin flips tell me not to do that. I don't know, man. I am praying a lot. He leaves tomorrow or the next day.</p>
<p>even before this Florida thing came up, I was praying a lot. I pray for my miracle. I pray for the thing that's going to make sense of my life. And honestly, I suspect I already received it. My mind has shifted very suddenly in these past days. I came to something of a realization that the reason I am so stressed the fuck out, and the reason my head is subsequently such a debilitating mess, is not at all because of my homelessness, but instead, is because I am trying to do two entirely contradictory things at the same time. That is: I am trying to follow the Lord with my whole heart, but I am simultaneously trying to address my own comfort and my own preferences as I deal with the street, which is inspiring me to resist what I am undergoing and keeping me from coming to a resolution about it in my mind. I feel like I understand completely. I feel like I can deal with what the fuck ever, and whatever happens happens, but that being unwilling to deal in that way is what makes the task unmanageable, when it is. What I'm getting at is that I don't feel I necessarily need something like this Florida thing to change my circumstances. It might still be the right idea, and that's completely beyond me, really, but I don't need it. What's especially sad is that I swear I knew this already when I first hit the street, and I just forgot and warped it after being fucked too hard in the ass.</p>
<p>I went for a stroll today. I went walking through the local neighborhood looking for unprotected wifi hotspots. I knew I would need one if I ever intended to send this letter. I can access my email from my crap phone, and I do, but I can't compose an email with it unless I hover in my inbox to do it, which drains my minutes for as long as I am typing. I have like 15 minutes left on the phone until the start of next month. I would swear I had upwards of 200 prior to my emailing you last. I suck. So, wifi hotspot it is.</p>
<p>there was a little more I had meant to include in this message as I vaguely rehearsed it in my mind, but I tried to type some of it out and I wasn't satisfied with what it looked like. I couldn't fit it anywhere. I don't know. Maybe next time or something. In the meantime, please enjoy this completely meaningless paragraph, courtesy of my anus.</p>
<p>my host has a cat here. Apparently she is 13 years old, but I would never have guessed it by the way she looks and acts. She is petite and kitten-like. I love her. I love just about every animal. I am very good with them: I intuitively understand them and their moods and likes in much the same way as I do with people. Many an antisocial and badly-behaved housepet has taken an uncharacteristic affinity to me in my day, believe you me. It's something of a thing of mine: the asshole pet whisperer, I am. But regular pets are pretty swell too. I fuck with them and push their boundaries, you see. Like people. I would send you a picture of my hand if I could figure out how to do it from my phone: it looks like I caught it in a garbage disposal. From playing. You would think I was abusing this cat if you saw us. She plays with me like she is fighting for her life. Screaming and everything. It is ridiculous.</p>
<p>well. I think I will go and stroll back to that wifi hotspot. It's not like I'm really doing much of anything beyond typing this email anyway. Just fucking off and introverting all day. Kinda cool while also being boring at the same time. Though I never bore of writing you, and I've also been reading my Bible a lot. I am glad to be here.</p>
<p>my host intends to split a hotel room this evening with some chick he's crushing on. I offered to just take a walk for a couple hours so they could romp around the house by themselves or whatever -- I mean, I live the fuck outside, what the hell -- but I guess they just really want this hotel room, so I will be left alone to do as I please, fairly soon, whenever my host ends up leaving. Maybe I should invite some bitches over. Or some kittens, for that matter! Decisions, decisions.</p>
<p>well, he took me along to go run some errands and whatever, so my plans to go and stroll have been postponed for the time being, but I'm sure I will make my way to that wifi hotspot eventually. Babble babble babble. I could type forever.</p>
<p>hope your day hasn't killed you yet! Take it easy.</p></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Sun, Aug 24, 2014 at 9:04 AM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>I survived my day yesterday! Holy molies that was insane! Left the house at 8 am, running running running all day, got back home at 9:30. I haf an hour between my start and end time at each event. Which is BARELY enough time. I usually give myself an hour and a half if the places are 30 minutes away from each other. 30 for travel, and 30 for each set-up and take-down. With a little wiggle room in case I have a hard time cutting off a line of kids or need to chat with the organizer to find out where I'm setting up or to bug them for a check or whatever else I have to do. But yesterday. Ahhh! I am so surprised I made it. And wasn't late to start at any of them. Holy shit. My phone for some reason was nearly dead by the end of the first event. So I had it on from then on only when I was driving with it hooked up to my car charger. I would start driving with almost no idea
where I was going, just a hint that I was going in the right direction. And at red lights and such, I pulled up the next location on my GPS once my phone had enough battery back to turn on successfully. I was freaking the hell out when I thought I was going the wrong direction on the turnpike at one point! But magically, I was not. Phew!</p>
<p dir=ltr>My brain was scrambled from the moment I woke up yesterday too. I microwaved myself breakfast to take on the road and then left the house without it. And i DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE that I never ate breakfast until I was on the turnpike on my way back home at 9 at night. I was thinking to myself "I remember seeing my delicious breakfast, and smelling my delicious breakfast, but did I eat it? Is it in the car somewhere? I don't remember tasting it. Oh fuck, it's still in the microwave. -_-"</p>
<p dir=ltr>So I survived the whole day on coffee and 4 cookies that the people at the first event gave to me as I was feverishly packing up my stuff.</p>
<p dir=ltr>The first event I had to bring balloons to. So I had a back seat full of helium balloons that I picked up from the dollar tree, and I had shoved them all down in the floor of the backseat so they wouldn't block my view through the back window. But I was fighting them all the way to the first event to keep them pinned down. Pretty hilariously frazzling. Have you ever driven with a car full of helium balloons? They find the most inconvenient spaces to float to. </p>
<p dir=ltr>I also forgot to bring sponges that I use to apply the base colors of the large designs. I was horrified when I got to the first event and figured that out. But then I realized nobody would notice but me if I didn't point out that's how I usually do things, and it was too late, and I had to make the best of it. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Aaaand... I gotta go. I could type lots. But I must leave the house in 20 minutes for ren faire and I have yet to eat breakfast and fix up my makeup. Girl problems.<br></p><font color=#550055>

Now I am resorting to smoking a cigarette and walking around a little to check my email. My hoodie is the only long-sleeved shirt I even have, and I can tell it is partially compromised by my having sweated into it earlier in the evening when it was warmer. I am considering wearing my last remaining pair of socks as gloves on my hands. But I'm still not considering going to Florida unless I am explicitly instructed to do it.</p>
<p>I learned just the other day upon mentioning the Florida proposition to my brother that our dad apparently made use of the same coin trick I did, and for the same purpose, in his process of determining whether to move our family from New York to Pennsylvania when I was very young. I found this interesting. My father was very strong in Christ, and he also had some pretty radical spiritual things happen to him, and he is in many ways the closest thing I have to a role model of a regular person. I will have to tell you about it sometime.</p>
<p>I wonder when I will get around to hearing how bad you are at speaking your thoughts. Until then: I am excited for the day, too, friend.</p>
<p>time to go back to my dark corner.

<p>anxiety occurs primarily as a result of two variables in particular. One is the amount of psychological distress you are able to experience while still retaining the ability to respond to this distress thoughtfully and with a sound mind. This threshold is heightened by the suppression of your volatile hormones by such stopgaps as your birth control, but the amount it is heightened is negligible.</p>
<p>two is your ability to identify and affect the individual psychological events by which this distress is caused in the first place. This ability develops with perspective, with knowledge, and with experience, and I know you are no stranger to it. This ability is able to be exercised so long as it exists and is not actively being disabled by overpowering stressors. As a result of its being exercised, you will be brought to the point of overpowering distress by progressively fewer factors and in progressively fewer ways, rendering the heightening of your stress threshold redundant and unnecessary. Of particular interest, this ability is thoroughly inhibited from developing and being exercised by stopgaps like your birth control.</p>
<p>take it easy, dear.</p>

But I've been delayed by unexpected complications.</p>
<p>earlier, a group of high school girls were hanging out right on top of my dark corner, and I opted to wait them out from a distance. I didn't want to approach them or show myself to them -- I would rather just hide in the shadows and conduct myself as though this person who goes to bed outside on the ground doesn't exist. All my things were already stashed in my sleep spot before these chicks even showed up, too, including my cigarettes. It was a true test of patience.</p>
<p>then, just now, after having already laid down, a group of unrelated young people spent some more time right next to me, filming what I guess was supposed to be a music video. They had tripods and fancy lights and I got to listen to some shitty rapper's lyrics for maybe a half hour instead of sleeping successfully. They were pretty rowdy. I kept sneaking glances at them and observing their locations expecting one of them to do something unruly to me in hopes of getting a rise out of his friends. But it never happened.</p>
<p>and now, I am typing an email. But I don't mind the typing an email part. I just downloaded all our email conversations to my phone earlier today, actually, so that I am able to access them without requiring an internet connection. The idea occurred to me pretty randomly. I decided I will probably be better entertained by reading over them than I will by most other things I leave myself to do throughout my days. But I guess we will see.</p>
<p>thank you for not holding it against me when I do things like speak against your anxieties with the intention of disempowering your moods. I know it's tempting to argue in favor of the seriousness of your troubles, and I know it's probably not very pleasant to hear a reasoned counterargument in response when your own experience seems to defy reason and your first impulse is to honor that seriousness. I doubt that you actually care, but I guess that, long story short, I am apologizing for sending a finger wagging sort of email instead of a hugging sort when I understood you were stressing. Maybe I am the only one who even noticed. I don't know.</p>
<p>your mention of fortifying yourself made me smirk and appreciate your awesomeness. I do wish you well for these three busy days, whatever they are. And in a totally unrelated note: my phone's autocomplete just suggested me the word "threesome" when I typed "three" for some reason. Maybe it's a sign? (I am joking.)</p>

<p>back in the Old Testament days, when God's servants would opt to build him altars and memorials and what have you, God was really particular about their only including rocks taken straight from the earth in their construction, rather than their being built with treated bricks or with any stone crafted in any way by human hands. The reason for this is because he made the rocks. He made them perfect. They were fine just the way they were. To present a gift to him by way of defacing his already sufficient creation, asserting that man's work was somehow more appropriate for the task by virtue of the abilities of its craftsmen -- this was like spitting in God's face. To call such a thing an offering to God was an abomination.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to speak against you, but all your talk about playing competitive chess, whether it is against others, against your hormones, or against your life, leaves a horrid taste in my mouth. Do you know what distinguishes me from the exploitative trickster you are paranoid I am? It is my submission. It is my working to counteract my own will in favor of what should rightfully make determinations for me. And do you know why you can't tell the difference? It's because you don't know anything about it.</p>
<p>stop squirming. I am on your side more than you can even imagine. I swear it.</p>
<p>I'm going to sleep. My mood will sound different tomorrow. I am praying. Don't be mad.</p>
<p>you're awesome.</p>

I always did. People do play games, and some of them are indeed dangerous. If you'll recall, it was me who told you about the feet guy, wasn't it? And I didn't tell you it was nothing to worry about, I told you it was something, and I told you to escape. So it's not like we really view these matters so differently.</p>
<p>when I tell you things, it's not because I want you to turn around and reverse your course. Such an approach is the hallmark of an immature person who will not acknowledge reality, and I am not that person. Rather, I tell you things because I already have some understanding of your course, and because I understand that course will come to include subtle divergences while still continuing in the same general direction, and I hope to help prepare you to select the paths of greatest payoff as you encounter them, in order that no small bump or hiccup may be wasted or needlessly repeated. Indeed, my approach toward you since the very beginning has been such that, while I have spoken to you according to where you are as maturely as I've been able, there remain many planted seeds I never expected to bloom at all except in the cases they are watered rightly and in their corresponding seasons, themselves serving little purpose beyond a decorative one in any case otherwise. If such an approach strikes you as unnecessarily dedicated, you should know that I do it to every person: practically everyone I deal with in my life is an investment of my many years of intensive labor, much of which is yet unprofitable and continues altogether unbeknownst to them. But if you are wary of such a puppeteer's intentions, you should know that I only do such things when I care, and because I care, a lot.</p>
<p>so you're strongly opposed to kids and marriage, huh. Fair enough. I used to feel the same, but my position has shifted some over time. As it stands, I think it would be awesome to have kids, or a kid, if it made sense to do it, but I'm also very much against my having kids unless it does, and I don't expect my future will be particularly conducive to my having children for a number of reasons, so I've all but resolved I will not have any children at all. On the other hand, I am very interested in being married, because I feel the corresponding commitment correctly reflects a man and a woman's ideal application unto one another, because I feel such application rightly compliments the nature of my person, and because I hope to one day have batshit crazy sex all the time with a clear conscience. Though, conversely, as I have little regard for human conventions and am also appointed as both a judge and a priest in Christ, I have no use for an earthly wedding, and I am not under compulsion to endear my marriage to anyone but God and my wife.</p>
<p>::flexes dick muscles::</p>
<p>I'm really something, you say. Who, me? You haven't seen nothin' yet, my dear. Or, should I say: this isn't even my final form! You are seeing but the tiniest sliver of a shadow. Though you are certainly welcome for all the emails -- not least of all, because I find you quite delightful also.</p>
<p>I am sure you are already at your birthday party and doing your thing by now. I am just sitting around peacefully waiting for my dinner, having myself some friendly interaction and maybe reading my Bible some amidst my many instances of fucking off and smoking the aimless cigarette awhile. I hope you are well today, and that your environment is good to you -- be your environment your own mind, the next gaggle of raucous children in line, or whatever combination thereof. And take it eaassyyy. Easy peasy. Don't die of a period. Yadda yadda.</p>

We have a history -- we are fairly close. She got progressively more drunk and miserable throughout the night. There were points where she was practically begging me to bang her. We cuddled some. I probably wasn't helping. I am lonely too, after all. But I behaved.</p>
<p>I just left her in the middle of the city by herself, drunk. She used my phone to get in contact with her boyfriend very briefly, and she would have me believe he was coming to meet up with her imminently, but I'm not convinced I even did the right thing at all by leaving her there. She was talking all kinds of shit about, I dunno, intentionally getting herself picked up by the police, blah blah blah. Just some erratic and depressed drunk person shit. She was even going off about how she wanted me to sit by or actively assist her while she committed suicide earlier in the evening. She wanted me to walk her or carry her to the top of this parking garage all the homeless people jump from to kill themselves, because she was nearly too drunk to walk. She mentioned the parking garage and I told her: I relate.</p>
<p>I've found myself in a position to preach Christ to some remarkably unexpected sorts of characters these past couple of days. This chick is probably the least unusual out of all of them. We had some intensive conversation, and she was interested. She heard me. I wonder if she will even remember after she sleeps.</p>
<p>I prayed the Holy Spirit wake me up and sound the alarm if this girl ends up heading off to kill herself later in the night, so I can catch her. Hopefully God listens. Truth be told, I am keeping vigil over the nearest entrance to the parking garage as I type this. But I am tired and I definitely need my sleep.</p>

I mean, unless I happen to see her fallen body in front of this parking garage by chance or something, I guess. That's happened before -- just be strolling down the street minding my own business and poof. Oh, hey, I knew that guy. Nobody even reports when it happens because nobody cares. It's up to the homeless people to tell each other about it. </p>
<p>I have high hopes though. I don't think she would've gone to such a length as staging her boyfriend's coming to meet her just so she could stumble off and kill herself. And I don't think the dude would've left her there while she was drunk like that. But I am much less convinced about that one. Sigh. We will see.</p>
<p>my dinners throughout the week all take place at around 5 or 5:30 in the afternoon. I'm usually hungry as fuck before I even go to sleep unless I happen to lay down particularly early for some reason -- which is typically just that exact reason, but whatever. It's a little better or worse depending on how much I had to eat for my dinner, but by breakfast time the next morning, I am pretty dependably starving no matter what I ate. This morning, I accidentally slept through my breakfast. I should've known better with as late as I laid down to go to sleep, but I doubt there's much I even could've done beyond just staying awake through the night, as I don't think I even have a working alarm of any kind.</p>
<p>now, I sleep through my breakfast every once in a while. Shit happens; whatever. What sucks is that there is never any lunch on Sunday, and the likelihood of today's dinner being closed is also very high. I really should've, like, thought about this, or something, before I went to sleep, but again, I don't even know what I would've done about it, so what the hell. I'm now deliberating whether I'm going to, I dunno, shoplift, troll for a donation on Craigslist, try and panhandle, or whatever the fuck. I might do all of the above but it'll probably end up being option A that fills my belly, which I hate. Maybe if I hint there's a possibility I'll be down to fuck after I eat, some Craigslist floozy will take me out to lunch. Or breakfast. It wouldn't even be the first time.</p>
<p>sorry for bitching about all my own bullshit. I'm not even in a bad mood about it or anything, really; I'm kinda just.... reporting. Oh well.</p>
<p>I wondered at first why you responded to my email so early in the morning, and I was curious if you were still awake for some reason, but then I remembered your mentioning waking up very early for your thing today. Your thing with your drapes and your shower curtain and your white tent. I think? I am too lazy to scroll my phone past this email and check. My memory is unreliable about such things because they're all such abstracts in my mind.</p>
<p>well, I guess I'm off to do whatever I'm doing. Hope your day is good. Hope my own day is good, too, but hey, yours being good would be pretty swell also.</p>

<p>on my way back toward center city after having already stolen a handful of roller grill items from a Turkey Hill, I stopped in the shade of a tree and sat down, hoping to cool myself off from all the walking I'd been doing. I wasn't seated there for more than maybe three minutes when some old and friendly dude starts hovering next to me on the side of the road in his SUV. He asks me for directions to the train station, mentioning how he's waiting for friends to arrive and has nothing to do with himself all afternoon except drive around. We chit chat a little bit, and the subject of my homelessness comes up in the course of his asking where I'm going, what I'm doing, or some other such question. He proceeds to invite me into his vehicle, and under what pretext, I don't even remember, but it was a loose one, and I accepted because I anticipated he would do something nice for me.</p>
<p>so we're driving around aimlessly, and I'm thinking he's going to offer to take me out to eat or something. I chat him up and act friendly. After some brief innocuous conversation, he starts asking me where to find a good porn store. He mentions how some of these adult bookstores will let you take a guest into a private room, blah blah blah, something something, maybe get a blowjob for twenty or thirty dollars. I'm just like, aaahah, nooo, no, I don't think so buddy. Just laughed him off and left it alone. So we go back to having entirely casual and normal conversation. Two times I see him out the corner of my eye reaching into his money clip and I ignore him. Two times he just hands me a small sum of money out of nowhere and tells me to take it. So I take it. He drops me off at a nearby McDonald's, where he presumes I am going to spend my money. I get out of the vehicle, and, right across the street from the McDonald's, I see a congregation of familiar homeless people serving themselves plates from a cookout in some dude's backyard. The end.</p>
<p>I am in the city square. It just started and then stopped raining in the brief time since I've been sitting here writing this email and charging my phone. I feel ripped off. I could really go for some killer rainfall. But hey, I do have money in my pocket. Fuckin' weird ass day.</p>
<p>hope yours is cool like mine, and, ideally, also includes fewer molestors. I dread imagining a woman ending up in half the situations I find myself in, holy crap. But oh well. A big boy am I.</p>

<p>you don't have to explain yourself being amused that we were both in the square at the same time without seeing each other as I was emailing you, silly. I was just messing with you. I am almost always messing around in some way. Or all ways.</p>
<p>the guy's name is Jeremy. He has an epic beard with big, gauged ears. He stinks like hipster. He's all right, and I've known him for a while, but his chick is a mess, and he doesn't know how to handle her. It's not even so much his fault as it is the symptom of his being a young person. Even still, I only have so much of a sense of humor about it.</p>
<p>the two of us had something of a competition over this chick early last summer or so. She was interested in me, but he was vying very hard for her attention. She gave him openings because she wanted the attention and she wanted me to see me put work in. I deflected his advances a few times. It was fun little games. I continued to let her flirt with the dude because I could tell she was too uncommitted and scared to do anything else. For a brief period, she would set time aside throughout the day to superficially conjoin herself to him like a girlfriend while also reporting to me throughout, because that's what she felt like doing and I understood. Eventually, with her getting drunk all the time and playing both sides of the fence, he ended up banging her and securing her allegience where I wouldn't. I saw her position shift and I decided to just leave her alone out of respect. I was not very surprised, and it didn't bother me very much to just let things play out as they did. Since then, we've all been friends, but we've been pretty weird friends. All of this only came up for the first time the other night between me and the girl.</p>
<p>I just woke up when I started typing this. I feel like I am still half asleep. Debating whether I will lay back down and sleep or not. I wouldn't want to miss my breakfast again. Decisions, decisions.</p>
<p>or not. Some friend of mine is inviting me to come over to her apartment and have breakfast with her and her kids. She has been inviting me to do things pretty often lately: so much, even, that I was wary of trying to ask her for any more when I found myself hungry yesterday and needed somewhere to eat. Though I've generally determined I will not refuse if I am specifically invited. A tricky game of juggling, that is.</p>
<p>have a good day n' shit. You might hear from me later or something. Yaaawn.</p>

Ugh! I enjoy his company. I really do, so much. He's a great person. But it is hard for me to whole-heartedly enjoy
the time when I am simultaneously worrying that he is thinking this will turn into a long-term romantic relationship.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><span>So he came over, I helped him with the rest of this online class he had to take to help his case when he goes to court over unfair tickets a cop gave him. And I was planning on telling him after the stress of the classwork was completely out of the way, when we were hanging out doing something leisurely after. So we get done with the classwork, and he was super super hungry and wanted to go out to eat with
me. I wanted to go to subway, so we drove to the lot with Subway, and subway was closed. Labor day. phooey. and the nice restaurant right next door was open. And he didn't want to wait any long to eat, so we went there. And of course, that is not the casual time I was looking for to discuss this whole what to expect out of this relationship thing with him. Not in a nice dining room with a waitress and ambiance and all that. That is not at all like grabbing a sub and self-serving your drink and sitting wherever you want. And he paid the bill like he has done every time, which is very sweet of him, but it is setting the tone of it being a romantic/date type outing. If we both paid for our own food, or we took turns paying, it would be like friends treating each other. But because he pays when we go out to eat, he's setting the scene of being the provider in a relationship with me.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">FFFFF. This is why I prefer to pay for myself. Sets everything nice and even. That's how it should be. No pressure. Then AFTER being settled in a relationship, if the guy wants to pay for everything, SURE! You are his lady, that makes perfectly good sense if he wants to treat his lady to things. But to immediately pay for someone just because they're a girl.. it's like immediately taking some kind of ownership or right to exclusivity and romance, before you even know them! I just. Mneh. Why.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">So then we went to a cute little shop village nearby that is nice to walk through. Walked around, having small-talk. and he started telling me cool stories about his life experiences. Very different from me, growing up in another country and having religious practices that I don't know much about, so every story he has is something new and interesting. We sat down and he was telling me more about him, and just like that, it was time to leave. We got up to leave, walking side by side, and he kept on telling stories, and reached over and held my hand. And I instantly felt dread that he made a very sweet move like that. Because that moment, I had to decide if I was going to
pull my hand away and interrupt him to initiate conversation of how I don't want a romantic relationship, or if I was going to be passive and allow him to hold my hand and continue with his story so as not to hurt his feelings and make it awkward. And what did I do? I did not pull my hand away. I felt so uncomfortable. And now I feel like I'm misleading him.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">So. we didn't kiss this time. Which is at least something. Because the last time we hung out, we kissed, and I was very obviously nervous and wary, and then we got into discussion in which I said that
it was too fast to be kissing and that we really should get to know each other better before making a decision as to whether or not we should pursue a romantic relationship. And that was even after me being very blunt earlier on in the evening telling him I don't want kids and all that stuff.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">He really doesn't know that much about me. Like I can tell he adores me. But he doesn't ask me the important questions. He hasn't given himself the opportunity to really truly know who I am before deciding he adores me. And I can sense he is uncomfortable to talk
about my past dating history. It's heart breaking, because I think he has feelings for me like he hasn't felt for anyone before. It's new, exciting, and he just wants to jump in! I remember when I was like that. I on the other hand am so analytical of the situation. I don't know how to explain this to him. I mean I do. It's just there's no way to put it without getting him down in the dumps about it.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">There is so much on his plate right now too. If the court thing doesn't go his way, he could lose his license. He now works 6 and sometimes 7 days a
week, saving up to continue college. If the court case goes bad, no license, can't get to his work. I don't know what he would do then. It would not go well. Not well at all. So he has that hanging over his head.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">The point I'm getting at is there is no good time to tell him. It's gonna suck no matter what time I choose to tell him. I'm trying to be thoughtful and not do it over text message, but I only see him twice a week, the day that he is working at Green Dragon, and Monday. And he is just SO excited to see me. So I don't know which is better. Texting
is impersonal, but then if he was unhappy about it, he wouldn't have to worry about being in front of me and still trying to put on a good face about it. And if I talk to him about it in person, I would be able to make sure that he understood, and it would be more personal and overall done better. But Then I'd have to let him down after days of anticipating seeing me and enjoying himself. Like today he told me, he is so stressed with everything going on, and his time with me is the only time he gets to relax and enjoy himself.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;font-style:normal;background-color:transparent">I am so tired.

I mean, we all crave it. It feels so good to have that closeness. That's why I was SO worried about the kissing.

And then I wrote it out on paper as soon as I got home and it made perfectly good sense. He thought I was uncomfortable because I thought he was try to move quickly trying to get into a sexual relationship with me. But that's not it at all. It's so obvious to me that I don't have to worry about that with him. I really really don't. But a romantic relationship. That's what I see him trying to develop, with all the best intentions, but blindly. Not knowing who I am and accepting what
I want in life. He thinks I do not see things. I think he does not see things.

was happening.

granting them the agency to do such things as: withhold their power<br>
completely and appear invisible, except in the cases you take their<br>
preferred medication, or practice their preferred lucid dreaming<br>
techniques, or wear their preferred charms as jewelry, or adopt their<br>
worldview of choice as a countermeasure against them. You don't<br>
realize that these guys have had the ability to reconstitute matter<br>
through the beliefs of a magician, or to overtake the entire<br>
personality of a human being by his responses to experiential data<br>
alone, for as long as history has even recorded, and that the only<br>
reason they aren't overtly doing these things in present day is in<br>
consideration of their long-term strategy they expect will work better<br>
to kill you -- which is succeeding, and which I know for sure is<br>
succeeding because of evidence. You have no fucking idea in the world<br>
how tremendously war is being waged against you.<br>

it is so serious that persons like myself must undergo such trials as<br>
miserable bouts of homelessness just to attain to a discipline to<br>
choose against their power, even in the case that this power and its<br>
dangers are completely palateable and already understood. Do you think<br>
that you will withstand when even the thickest and most sturdy of<br>
trees are uprooted and moved from their place? Who the fuck are you?<br>

I don't know. Nothing. Hung out at this friend's house and watched a<br>
movie and had some conversations earlier in the day. Went to my<br>
dinner. I don't remember. Hid from the rain? Socialized and stuff. I<br>
don't know.<br>
<br>
I saw Justin earlier. I confirmed that he and the dude had invented<br>
some story about my causing problems so I would leave and Justin could<br>
get his dick sucked. I remember: there was a point where Justin had<br>
told my brother this bullshit story about my getting myself kicked out<br>
of the house by causing problems. I told my brother what I was<br>
convinced had actually happened instead, but my brother kept shutting<br>
me down really inconsiderately and calling me delusional, like there<br>
was no chance at all that my suspicion could've even been reasonable.<br>
It made me furious. I want to rub it in his face, but I don't want to<br>
blow up Justin's business.<br>
<br>
that sucks about your wisdom tooth! I kinda just let mine rot out of<br>
my mouth and chipped them away over time until they were nothing,<br>
personally.... I'm just cool like that<br>

maybe if your face paint client holds your hand and pays for your meal<br>
you guys can negotiate a price for the work.<br>
