<p>I hope your nap was good. I hope your whole day is good, really. And your week! And, and, and, shit! Good morning.</p>
<p>I caught your email right when I woke up, but I figured I would just let it hang, since you were sleeping. I spent the rest of the morning at my chick friend's house. At my chick friend Danielle's house.</p>
<p>Danielle woke me up with a bunch of texts I couldn't read at about 7 this morning, so I headed over there as soon as I was done rolling around in my blanket. She made me breakfast when I got there, and we watched a movie. She was reaching pretty hard today, too, I gotta say. Wearing some uncharacteristic low-cut shirt and repeatedly finding transparent excuses to dangle her tits in my face. I mean, shit. I like boobs as much as the next guy. Maybe more! But that doesn't mean your boobs will magically cause me to act any differently than I would normally act without the boobs. (Not your boobs, dear. Her boobs. Fuck.)</p>
<p>anyway. Now I am on my way out, just using her neighbor's wifi in her driveway real fast before I take off. I wonder what weird shit I will do today. Maybe drink some free coffee? Yes, I like the sound of that.</p>
<p>I'm carrying Nazi's backpack with me for the time being. He lost it when the cops picked him up. I wasn't present when it happened -- someone else picked it up off the ground and stashed it somewhere. I asked around and eventually got my hands on it, and now I am carrying it, because that's the only way I trust that nothing will happen to it. Thankfully, there are no glaring swastikas on the backpack. That is more than I can say about some of his other backpacks.</p>
<p>take it easy pumpkin.<br>
