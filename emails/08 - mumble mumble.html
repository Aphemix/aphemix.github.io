It no longer feels difficult or unusual for me to do. At the same time, coffee, generally speaking, has tended to incline me toward wanting to smoke cigarettes, so I have also abstained from drinking coffee, and I guess I'm just quitting coffee, too. I'm not really so adamant about this one, and haven't committed myself to doing it long-term, but I might just continue not drinking coffee for the hell of it, as I know I don't need it, and I probably am just better off not drinking it.<br>
<br>I got a new phone, but I have yet to switch my old plan over to the new phone, as I'm not sure how troublesome it will be to do it, and I guess I'm just lazy. Now I walk around with two phones -- one I once used, which is now smashed, and another that doesn't do anything, because I have yet to activate it. I'm sure I will work this out very soon.<br>
<br>my week feels rather strange.... rather interesting.... but I am not sure how easily I am able to summarize its strangeness or my interest. Truth be told, I am here in part to scope out my audience. It is usually only after doing such things that I even know how I am to respond or what is even happening. Meanwhile, I feel a little lost.

My cousin's sister and her family are up from Florida, visiting before grandpa passes, which is coming very very soon. He just started on Morphine. So anywho, she paid me 40 bucks just to cover my expenses for me to do henna tattoos for all of them. So I brought henna, and face paint. My one little 3 year old cousin was the only one to get her face painted. Then I did henna on everyone else. And proceeded to get mildly drunk at the same time from less than 2 drinks.
&nbsp;I didn't realize how strong my cousin had mixed it. HA! so I spent the night there, sharing a twin bed with one of my cousins because there was so many of us, there was not a free couch. Before going to bed, I had to babysit one of my cousins that drank way too much and got very very sick. Sat with her on her bedroom floor with a trashcan, and fetched other puking necessities as needed. Also assisted in going to the bathroom. All that fun stuff. There was lots of laughing and carrying on for that part. It was some seriously good cousin bonding time. Never had any moment so close to her as then. Then her phone white-screened over night and there was no fixing it. so I made sure the next day I got an old phone of mine to her.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">That was Monday in a nutshell.

I smoked <i>dat k2 </i>that one time I mentioned to you, when Nicky my ex-wife briefly had my panties up in a bunch, but, aside from that, I've dealt with difficulties and have not cared to do the drug at all. It's been probably a month or longer since I've actively done the drug or considered myself at risk of doing it -- a month or longer having only done it that one time.<br>
<br>side note, though. I heard from Nicky recently, for the first time since my intentionally dodging her and leaving her to her own business on the street. It had been something like a week since we spoke. She tells me, suddenly, though, and totally out of nowhere, that she has a confession to make, that she thinks she's in love with me, that she even broke up with her long-distance boyfriend specifically to be with me. I'm just like, <i>what. </i>I mean, I know this last part <i>must </i>be false -- she had a lot of things tangled up in this long-distance relationship she was intending to pursue; I kinda figured her taking to me, in itself, was a symptom of her already looking for a means of sabotaging those plans. Either way, I have a confession to make, too, and, while I definitely do love the chick to death, I am not at all interested in dating her or committing myself to her. I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to break this to her. She is hyperactive -- I might just wait until she distracts herself elsewhere.<br>

I had a blanket covering me up to my waist since my cousin was sleeping on top of the other side of it. And the window was open, and I was right next to the window. Chilly! Had to both lay on our sides all night to make it work. Finally got out of bed at 7 with a nasty pain in my neck from sleeping funny. Totally worth the memory though. Snuck out of that room without waking either of the people in there, went into my sick cousin's room and sat with her for a little bit, and she was dry heaving at that point. Nothing left to throw up. poor girl. and that's when I found out her phone busted for her, and told her I'd make sure I'd get a phone to our other cousins when I saw them again later in the day.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">Gathered all my stuff up and left by 7:30. home by 8. didn't change or fix my face up or nothing, just left straight from there in another 20 minutes to visit my mama and sister. Had a nice breakfast together, i gave them both henna too because i had some left over from the henna cone the night before. Watched compilations of cute pet videos on youtube with my sister and laughed until we cried. As soon as my mom went off to work, I left for my grandparent's house. Which is where my other cousins were, so I could conveniently get the phone to them at the same time. Did henna on one other person (Dang I get a lot out of one henna cone). Then took a nap there while they were finishing up a board game. As soon as I woke up from my nap i was directed to drive with a
cousin to the store and pick up fried chicken and potato wedges for everyone. Then ate, played games, visited. I gave grandma and makeshift, sitting-up back massage while everyone was visiting. and then a facial massage. She'd never had anything done like that, so it was a treat. Grandpa happened to be awake when I looked over, so I offered him a facial massage. He fell hard asleep 4 minutes into it. Which was cute. I worked on him for maybe 20 minutes anyways.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">Drove home in the nasty partial snow, took a shower, passed out.

Since first committing to quitting smoking on Sunday, I've been really adamant about approaching the task with a right mind. I have practiced an even greater attentiveness than usual --hoping to identify what factors enable me, in order that I would encourage them, yet also being mindful of the things that could worsen my difficulties, meaning similarly to abstain from them. As such, my attempt to quit smoking quickly came to take on a meditative and spiritual character, feeling much more like a fast or some strange and mystical purification process, and having almost no direct correlation to the cigarette habit at all. I must admit, I kinda like it better this way: it has served to distract me almost completely from my meaning to quit smoking in the first place. I don't know how that works, but it does.<br>
<br>my greater attentiveness has distinctly flavored my experience these past days. My consciousness is no longer punctuated by my smoking a cigarette or caring about one every so often. I appreciate very small things. I am unaffected, even by large things. Even by being pissed off in my irritated state, I am unaffected, and I do not act unbecomingly -- something that is very significant to me when compared against what I would otherwise expect of my own behavior. It's been weird, man. I have felt largely that I am separate from my life, or that I am being made separate from my life. I don't know what it is for sure, but in thinking about it, I can speculate: I have figured for some time that my cigarette habit was among the very few concrete ways I have even remained invested in what happens to my body or my life. Without my mindstate depending on my having cigarettes to whatever extent it has, I am essentially&nbsp;<i>completely free,&nbsp;</i>even from my own&nbsp;<i>moods.&nbsp;</i>Does that sound ridiculous, or what? I mean, it sounds ridiculous as I type it. I don't know how true it is. But it's something I'm in the process of working out, and, meanwhile, it's not even really new information to me at all. It has some precedent in my mind. But I don't know.<br>
<br>I've been praying a lot. I've been reading the Bible a lot, and almost exclusively, also, as, by my current approach to my days, I am largely without the traditional distractions by which I have otherwise tended to keep myself busy. It's really weird: perhaps&nbsp;<i>every single time&nbsp;</i>I have read my Bible this week, I have experienced overwhelming fatigue as I have read, even to the extent that I will fall in and out of sleep rapidly as I am reading. I have this suspicion my transitioning between sleep and wakefulness has some strange, as of yet unknown effect on my mind by which I am made better able to receive and be affected by what I am reading -- but that is quite a peculiar suspicion, isn't it? Nevertheless, I have resolved to focus myself and absorb as much as I am able through these means, and, holy crap, I have proceeded to learn such&nbsp;<i>radical&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>outrageous&nbsp;</i>th<wbr>ings. Things I have never before conceived, I have learned. Why do I even share this with you? I don't know. Because I like to, I suppose.<br>
<br>my interesting week has included a fair bit more than this, and I also doubt my interesting week is over. But, significantly, I feel my difficulty in quitting smoking has passed, and that I am not at risk of acting wrongly toward you as a result of my difficulty. So, poof. Here I am, also. In a hurry to get back to you, really. And hump hump hump. Good to see you.<br>
<br>I'm at my brother's again. I spent some consecutive nights outside, eventually finding my few layers of clothes irreconcilably soaked by the rain and my health immediately endangered by the cold. I asked my brother to take me in, feeling sheepish that I had just recently been granted an allotment of time with him as a prior favor this past week, but, even still, he picked me up, and I now have yet to leave. I assume I will end up back on the street within the day, but, beyond that, I don't really know what I am doing.<br>

The library is closed on Sundays, and, while the library is not quite the only place nearby where I am able to plug in my laptop and access wifi, it is just about the only place I will feel inclined to station myself and get comfortable where I may also do those things. On the other hand, I'm typing to you now from the center square of Lancaster city -- where I am plugged into a street lamp, outside, and am leeching internet either from a hotel or a bank. But, to be fair, I am already tired of sitting here.<br>
<br>I finally transferred my phone plan, today, from the smashed phone I've been carrying around to the new phone I recently purchased. My phone number is the same as it was, and you are welcome to dig through our emails and reference it if you'd like, but I imagine your actually doing so would be a rather cumbersome task, so, were you to keep from doing it, I can't say I'd fault you for the behavior. <i>Clearly, I am a very reasonable person, </i>he squealed in a high-pitched whistle.<br>
<br>since the beginning of this month, women, rather than the traditional men alone, have been housed at the same shelter I sleep in, even to the extent that our beds are all kept in the same large room. On the bright side, I get to bask in their laughably exaggerated exclamations of horror and outrage as I lay innocuously in my bunk and loudly ricochet my professional ventriloquist's fart blasts off every corner of the room aforementioned, which is <i>fucking awesome, every time.&nbsp;</i>On a less convenient note, however, my shelter is left able to harbor fewer men, total, which means I must take greater precaution and wait outside in line much earlier if I ever hope to sleep indoors. Seeing how I have far too few layers of clothing with which to address even my present chill, I do, indeed, ever hope to sleep indoors.&nbsp;Though I still, potentially, may, if I can ever figure out how to do it from my phone, it is on this general basis that I do not see myself going any further out of&nbsp;my way to access the internet on this particular evening.&nbsp;<br>
<br>my day was good. Hope your day was also good.

I will speak to you in a parable.<br><br>I want you to imagine, if you will, a stuntman, jumping his body from one moving car to another. This, of course, is a pretty risky maneuver. The stuntman can't make the jump too early, or from too far away, for instance, because the danger is too great. That is, he might miss the jump, or, at the very least, he might be required to sacrifice a great deal of precision and safety in order to put a sufficient amount of force into the jump. One way or the other, though, each one of these approaches is very risky, and each one is likely to have a very sloppy result. It is important that the results of the jump not be sloppy: this is serious business. Someone could get hurt.<br>
<br>you may say this issue has a&nbsp;<i>simple&nbsp;</i>solution: just give the stuntman all the time he needs. Eventually, the jump will be perfect. Eventually, if a perfect jump is&nbsp;<i>possible,&nbsp;</i>it will reveal&nbsp;<i>itself.&nbsp;</i>But I'm afraid this proposal shows a distinct ignorance of the complex discipline that is our stunt jumping. You see, in reality, as more time passes, the risks actually&nbsp;<i>increase.&nbsp;</i>The two cars might crash into each other, for example. Even with cruise control, and even with&nbsp;steering&nbsp;<i>expertly&nbsp;</i>synchro<wbr>nized between the two drivers of the two cars, the risk of a crash is&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>getting bigger as time goes on.<br>
<br>so maybe that risk is very small, you say. Maybe you're making a fuss about nothing. Indeed, if the drivers know what they're doing, I do concede: the risks might remain very small. But there are yet more complications. You see, even if the drivers are&nbsp;<i>perfect,&nbsp;</i>and are of one mind,&nbsp;<i>completely,&nbsp;</i>their maintaining a low risk and a safe environment is still&nbsp;<i>hugely&nbsp;</i>dependent on the&nbsp;<i>condition&nbsp;</i>of the&nbsp;<i>road.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>now, this is a pretty dangerous trick. If the stuntman has&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>clue what he's doing, at&nbsp;<i>all,&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;<i>course&nbsp;</i>he's going to account for the road ahead. He's going to make sure the road is safe; he's going to make&nbsp;<i>sure&nbsp;</i>it doesn't cause&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>problems for the duration of the stunt. He's probably even going to clear&nbsp;the hazards&nbsp;from the road&nbsp;<i>himself,&nbsp;</i>so he&nbsp;<i>knows.&nbsp;</i>But these matters, again, become much, much more complicated as more time passes, because a much greater number of resources will be required to address a corresponding greater stretch of road. Of even more significant concern, as well, these roads are very, very big. Many cars use them. It is essentially&nbsp;<i>impossible&nbsp;</i>for a stuntman to account for anything except a very limited stretch of road: even the tiniest of nails may be a deadly hazard, you see. That's just the nature of the game.<br>
<br>I know what you will say to all of this. You will say, why bother? None of this matters unless you're trying to do this ridiculously dangerous thing, this jumping from one moving vehicle to another in the middle of the road. That's the only reason anybody would ever care about this! What is the point? Why would anyone ever participate in that? Why would&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>ever participate in that?&nbsp;<i>I am scared. I am happy just driving.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>I know what you will say, but I am telling you anyway. This stuntman is a professional. He has his reasons, and they are good reasons, but this is a very dangerous trick. He knows exactly what he is doing, but there are&nbsp;<i>complications.&nbsp;</i>You see, when he stands on the hood of his car, to show that he is completely steady, and when he cruises right up next to the other car without leaving a scratch, to show that his maneuvers are perfect, and when he whistles loudly to announce himself, in order that he may be heard over the commotion of the trick, the other driver is&nbsp;<i>terrified.&nbsp;</i>Even if he whistles an&nbsp;<i>explanation,&nbsp;</i>she is terrified.<i>&nbsp;</i>She drives erratically. Indeed, she speeds off as quickly as she can.<br>
<br>the stuntman&nbsp;<i>does&nbsp;</i>have his reasons, and he&nbsp;<i>does&nbsp;</i>know&nbsp;<i>exactly&nbsp;</i>what he is doing, but all of this complication puts&nbsp;<i>both cars&nbsp;</i>at risk. Now, he is a professional. He is ready to walk effortlessly from one car to the next, if he&nbsp;<i>can,&nbsp;</i>but he will take corrective measures, too, if he&nbsp;<i>must.&nbsp;</i>No one will be harmed. I reiterate:&nbsp;<i>no one&nbsp;</i>will be harmed. The jump&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>be sloppy if things are not in order. The other driver&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>be terrified. But no one will be harmed under&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>circumstances. Rather, all of this will be much better understood the instant the stuntman finally enters the second car. There will not be nearly so many distractions then. There will no longer be any more reason to be frightened.<br>
<br>he who has ears to hear, let him hear! Ha ha ha. <i>I had to.&nbsp;</i><br><br>I don't mean to alarm you. I don't mean to sound insistent. I swear I don't. I want you to be as unperturbed as is possible, really, and even at the expense of my own convenience, for that matter, I do. I am not exaggerating at all when I tell you that is exactly where I'm coming from. Truly, it's a good place. But I'm still bugging you. I'm not doing it by&nbsp;<i>accident&nbsp;</i>-- because my quitting cigarettes has ruined my mood, for example, or for any other such reason. I'm not. I'm just&nbsp;<i>doing&nbsp;</i>it. And I am not confused.<br>
<br>I'm sure all of this has the capacity to sound rather overbearing when it is thrown in your face like this, as a complete package, in an email. This is because our distant contacts are lacking the subtle acknowledgments and reciprocation between parties that are intrinsic to a more direct manner of interpersonal exchange, and the absence of those elements makes it much more likely you will feel oppressed by some impersonal&nbsp;<i>thing,&nbsp;</i>even in the case that you are just being challenged a little bit by a person. I have tried to compensate for this dynamic, and I'm pretty excellent at doing it, but, as one inevitable&nbsp;<i>result&nbsp;</i>of my doing it, I have proceeded to mesmerize you. This is just a small sampling of an issue that, in its totality, is much, much too big for our current emails.<br>
<br>you should make use of my phone number. <a href=tel:%28717-341-4569 value=+17173414569 target=_blank>(717-341-4569</a>.) You don't have to do this, but you should. Particularly, because it will make you feel more resolved about all of this nonsense in a way that will not simultaneously be intimidating like it will if we are to address it by email. I know what I'm talking about. Just&nbsp;<i>do what I tell you&nbsp;</i>-- if you&nbsp;<i>want,&nbsp;</i>pretty please, and with a mango on top, that is. But you should. Really. I don't want to bother you, and I'm still telling you. I don't even&nbsp;<i>like&nbsp;</i>the phone, and I'm still telling you.<br>
<br>parables are awesome. They have the ability to confer a great amount of understanding, because their content is not limited by the rules of semantic logic in the same way as it would be in the context of more traditional speech. They are something like the linguistic versions of dreams. I am not at all surprised to discover I am skilled with them.<br>
<br>gosh, this really wasn't anything like a normal email at all, was it. I suck. Oh well.<br><br>dinner time.<br><br></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Mon, Apr 21, 2014 at 5:23 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div class=replyto>Reply-To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue,Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;font-size:12pt"><div>Okay.

Not on purpose. I don't know what to say.<br><br><i>I had a vision about you, </i>dammit. Don't hate me for being confused. I know you don't. Just, don't.<br><br>
I told you about a chick a little while ago. I was interested in her, and it seemed like a pretty done deal, but my brother ended up fucking the shit up, helping wedge us apart, banging her for a little while, blah blah blah. I was incredibly furious with my brother about it for a couple of days, and it hurt my heart, but I got over it really quickly and it never came up again.<br>
<br>just recently she reappeared in my life. Just yesterday, at my shelter, she suddenly sat down at my table at breakfast. I was already kinda expecting some <i>other </i>shit yesterday, so, long story short, I was already on the lookout. I <i>immediately rejected </i>the manilla envelope that was her appearance -- I was quite resentful of it. I said in my mind, <i>no. </i>No, I don't want this. Leave me alone. Stop fucking with me.<br>
<br>today, holy crap. I can't believe this was only a day ago. Today, though, I see her again. After my dinner, just standing around. I try to dodge her. I tell myself it's for the reason that I not inadvertently obligate her to deal with me, but who knows what the fuck the real reason is. She calls for my attention after I walk past, so my excuse is immediately broken. We end up chatting for a while. Chatting flirtatiously, having a really good time and shit -- though I've been in an awesome place all day, and I kinda just flirt with everybody, so it's not like it really means anything. I even make sure I explicitly tell her I'm not available.&nbsp;<i>Don't worry, I'm not prowling, </i>I tell her. <i>I am not romantically available.&nbsp;</i><br>
<br>we talked long and hard about <i>that </i>one. Do you know that I've been rejecting other women for you, you little punk? That I will feel guilty in my heart even without being obligated at <i>all, </i>and will refuse to allow myself beyond a certain level of involvement, of my own will,&nbsp;<i>just </i>because I feel like it's wrong -- even <i>believing </i>you <i>definitely </i>wouldn't&nbsp;<i>care, </i>specifically <i>intending </i>you <i>never </i>even&nbsp;<i>know? </i>I've been like this for months. I don't tell you about it, because, what the fuck? <i>Why </i>would I tell you? For recognition? Do you owe me something? Nope! It would just be fucked up, right? Right? Well, now you know. Don't hate me. It's just my thing. I don't hate you, either. I'm just telling you. I'm just telling you for the story, because who cares, and it doesn't even matter.<br>
<br>so we're here chatting flirtatiously. Standing in front of the shelter. Lots of people walk past on the street, and I will sometimes have brief words with them, because I know everybody. There's this one guy who I know just very recently got right with Jesus Christ. He is on some <i>other </i>shit. Some shit that makes me <i>envious, </i>even. He's just.... he's so incredibly passionate about how saved he is, and about abandoning his old life, and about expressing all this love and gratitude, it's just.... it's this really amazing thing. It's this thing that I, having the reference points of my own understanding as well as my own previous experience of his person, really, really appreciate and accept as valid. Even to the point that I am envious.<br>
<br>so this guy walks up to me, and, out of nowhere, he calls me close to whisper something into my ear. He tells me -- basically, he tells me that he thinks my vision was about this girl I was with. Like it was good news. And it's <i>so fucked up! </i>It's fucked up because I could tell he didn't understand what I had told him about the vision in the first place -- he didn't even realize it featured one person in particular. He thought it was a mystery. He was just <i>mistaken. </i>But poof! He delivered the envelope. And I'm just like: what the fuck just happened to me? <i>Please </i>tell me I'm just losing my freakin' mind. You motherfucker. Did he just speak a prophetic word to me?&nbsp;<i>Furious. </i>Absolutely fucking enraged. How <i>dare </i>you! I'm about to storm from <i>this </i>dream pissed off <i>just </i>like I did the other one. About to open my real eyes until I pop right the fuck out of this imaginary body, fuck this place. Fuck this place. I'm so freakin' heated, I can't even believe it.<br>
<br>and it's like, wait. <i>Am </i>I just losing my freakin' mind? How serious <i>is </i>this shit? Didn't my ex-wife Nicky just come at me a few days ago, too, telling me she was in love with me all of a sudden, on some trying to date me bullshit? What the fuck is <i>happening </i>to me? And, of course, I am arch chameleon mode over here. I am all possibilities at the same time. So what is happening to me? Simple. I'm just splitting up into different pieces. And all the pieces are all fucked up in their respective different universes at the same time. <i>No big deal! Business as usual over here! </i>And I just want to curl up into a giant astral fibration and bawl the fucking ocean, man. I have no idea what is what. I am a leaf in the wind. You can't help me. It's just the wind.<br>
<br>that stuntman in the parable <i>wasn't me, </i>you know. There's a third person here! <i>I'm just driving his car. </i>You should've seen the fucked up shit he did to get into <i>my </i>car! We were, like, <i>airborne..... </i>fucking hell, we're probably still airborne. Where the fuck is my spaceship, bitch. This is <i>too </i>crazy.<br>
<br>I'm really sorry. I'm not fucking around. I'm really sorry if I have inconvenienced you. It will level itself out. Trust me.<br><br>my laptop is about to die. I might find somewhere to be later on in the evening or something.<br>

And this probably goes without saying. But I don't want to you to hold me in this regard that makes you closed off to ladies in your life. But at the same time I get it. It's not necessarily the person, but the idea of them. The grass is greener on the other side. The unattainable seems magical. When a person triggers you to idealize, it seems others just won't do. But I guess it does fade out in time doesn't it? Or maybe it positively raises your standards and expectations of the people around you until a perfect contender comes up to the plate and replaces who you idealize. Idk. At least I can see that. That's probably my system. I don't know, the system hasn't been running long
enough yet to see that kind of pattern form. But I'm an idealist. And I've built my romantic interest on sky scrapers of strange and beautiful day dreams. To the point no person could rise to meet it. Unless I am actively fantasizing about that person, building them up as well. I put my interests on a pedestal. They seem greater to me than any other, when really they're as human as the rest. It's kind of a downfall if I'm not careful. But then again it's not even that I'm not careful. It's that I'm immediately blinded upon being locking on my target to idealize. Not even blinded. I can't say that either. But.. I don't know. I have no control over idealizing someone. My heart ignores all those warning signs my brain points out to it. I know me. I can be the queen of denial. But you know what, at least I'm aware now. Armando taught me that. The pain of having all the things resurface that I buried from myself is enough to make me pay attention for the
next time. I have Philly man on a pedestal, but I'm pointing out to myself things that I don't like and potential problems or signs of misalignment in character. Regardless, I adore him. And there's no sign of it going anywhere. But regardless it just is. Reminds me a bit of this very same situation here with you closing yourself off to ladies after you. And of some of the things you say about your feelings toward me. Why do we want the things that are proposed to us to be unattainable? Suddenly just because they are labeled unattainable, they are the best of the best and we must have them and try and try and try for them. Because they must be extra special. Surely anything that is a challenge to obtain is the very best. They allow us the opportunity to expand on fantasies of what it could be like. Fill our brains up with beautiful "what ifs."</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">At this point in my life, I kind of appreciate the beauty of the fantasies and the what-ifs more than I appreciate obtaining what I am fantasizing and what-iffing about.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">The world up in my head is so vivid and perfect and

<br>I sent the email on April 11 in the "Must have coffee" series of emails. My inbox is telling me this also happened 11 days ago, and suddenly my wacked out mind is rapidly and involuntarily entertaining all manner of bizarre numerological connection in an offhanded scan for any potentially existing meaning whatsoever. Did you know there are 22 characters in the Hebrew alphabet, and that each one of these letters correlates precisely to a book of the Bible, in correct sequence, three times in a row, for each of the 66 books in the present-day canonization of the Protestant Bible? Do you think I am joking? I kinda <i>am </i>joking; I'm making a joke of my ridiculousness on purpose. But I am simultaneously serious. I am crazy.<br>
<br>I don't idealize you. I don't even believe I view you <i>inaccurately, </i>at least not in a way that is of any significance. I just <i>prefer </i>you. That's it. I <i>selected </i>you. It is of little consequence to me that I have never actually met you before: maybe you don't notice these things, yourself, but it is entirely commonplace for a person, even in the event he is surrounded by those he has known all his life, to interact with and experience <i>himself, only, </i>having no idea anything is even amiss<i>. </i>I do not doubt for a second that my experience of your being is many times richer than this: indeed, it is completely necessary, and even inevitable, that I develop the ability to know a person entirely independently from their relationship to me. Look:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John+4:20" target=_blank>http://www.biblegateway.<wbr>com/passage/?search=1John+4:20</a><wbr>.<br>
<br>I almost smoked a cigarette yesterday. I was so freakin' overwhelmed at around the same point I had finished writing my last email to you. I had already resolved to smoke one, I discovered a cigarette fragment of a suitable size on the ground, and I stopped in my tracks, completely intending to pick it up and smoke it as quickly as I could, <i>hoping </i>to sabotage myself <i>more </i>quickly than I could stop myself with reason. I was right about to pick it up, and suddenly, from across the street, I heard a voice scream: <i>NO!!! </i>I was rattled from what I was doing by <i>shock, </i>and I looked over to where the noise had originated from, wondering what the hell had even just happened. I saw some old couple sitting peacefully at a restaurant's outdoor table, not doing or saying anything to suggest they even had a reason to yell or be loud. I walked away in total bafflement, but I never smoked a cigarette. I almost did it to myself again this morning, too. I mean, I've been going pretty bonkers. This time, your email stopped me.<br>
<br>I am due for a shower, too. I am suddenly reminded of another vision I received in a dream, some years ago. It is the first vision from God I ever received, with this recent one being only the second. I have a description I wrote immediately after I woke up from it, and I have decided to attach it with this email. Maybe you will appreciate it. Maybe not, but oh well. Have.<br>
<br>my morning is sufficiently pleasant. Thanks for not hating me. Seriously. It means a lot.<br><br><br></div></font></div><br clear=all><div style="width:50%;border-top:2px #AAAAAA solid"></div><table class=att cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=0><tbody><tr><td><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tbody><tr><td><a target=_blank href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=501086b476&amp;view=att&amp;th=1458a04ae1745458&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=attd&amp;realattid=f_hubc78s90&amp;safe=1&amp;zw"><img src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQANUgANvh8gZCm0RrvGCAylhwppOr5rnI7XmT1oCe5jJVmT1otmeK1TVesgg4ia672IOc2ipit4uk3Vd90E52y3eKnGd+syg+bfDy+oml6U1qpwlLsgU2goSEhMbGxgAAAP///////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAACAALAAAAAAQABAAAAaIQJCQQywahUgQ58NsMjkeYaGAQRwWkokA8oSCCk6nhukpexCGxwCwJkQ0nfincwaoAQJAhjKezz0HHwcCDgkRCQYBHX50Cx8VAgQbDBYfioweEh8EiBsbDh8NcYt0Ex+TFxsKTBtOdKthrKN/EBq2AbgNnq5RQ2GjpL1KsbxIHMDIccJQZs3NQQA7 width=16 height=16></a><td width=7><td><b>dad-dream.rtf</b><br>9K </table></table></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>Rebekah R </b>&lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Tue, Apr 22, 2014 at 11:31 AM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: "&lt;φ3" &lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td valign=top><p dir=ltr>Oh THAT vision.

<p dir=ltr>I've had coffee but no breakfast yet. Because I'm so distractable. My tummy is PISSED. Maybe I should go appease it. I don't feel like it though. My brain and my tummy do not cooperate with each other very well.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I may go to the park and paint random kids. I'm kind of in the mood for that today. Though the park could be dead, it being a Tuesday and all. I may scope it out. After I'm done doing doing chores around the house. And oh yeah, eating. Eating too. I'm so lazy when it comes to food.</p>

I may do that when I am finished typing just to get it out of the way.<br>
<br>aside from that, hopefully not smoke any cigarettes. For some reason this has been unusually difficult where it previously wasn't even a little bit difficult. I swear, I don't even want to do it! I don't know why -- I just don't! I suspect I am being deliberately administered experience that includes a selective degree of difficulty, in order that I may be trained to better resist what I want, but the science of these things is completely beyond me.

I used to do the same show and tell thing when I had a camera, remember? Granted, I never actually painted my face. But on the other hand, my whole life is my face, and I painted it with stories. You get me?<br>
<br></div>I could go for some Salvation Army clothes myself. I am sure I have fewer total articles of clothing than I even have fingers on my hands, and I rarely even replace them. I actually went to a clothing giveaway thing I suspect was Salvation Army affiliated, though, just the other day. I browsed with my eyes from a room away for, like, two seconds, decided I didn't want anything that was being offered, and promptly departed with my friends to some apartment, where they proceeded to blow k2 and cigarette smoke in my face for the next couple of hours until I got bored and scurried away to write you more emails. I mean, I could use the clothes, but, honestly, I'm homeless, and I'm well past the point of giving a shit about such trivialities as maintaining a fancy wardrobe. I have people try to chide me about it every so often -- I tell them I am the opposite of a human being. I wear the same dirty shit every day on the outside, but on the inside, I change daily. Yep yep. More of that selective attribution of meaning, magical willpower determination crap, you see. Pervasive all throughout my being, it is. <i>A spooky owl am I.</i><br>
<br></div>I'm not sure what I'm gonna do about this weather. The cold has been somewhat convenient for me in the sense that it has allowed me to wear all my layers at the same time. I'll cycle them from top to bottom according to my personal preference, sure, but I'd almost never explicitly be stuck carrying or stashing extra items I didn't immediately need. Now that it's getting warmer out, though, I know I can't be bothered to wear all this superfluous material -- not least of all, because I will be at a greater risk of sweating into it, after which I will either stink miserably like a homeless person, as a result, or, alternatively, just end up being overly dependent on my available laundry facilities. Either way, <i>this will not do! </i><br>
<br>furthermore, of even more pressing concern, it is going to be rather burdensome to continue wearing a hoodie. I wear a hood rather perpetually, you see, and as a sort of Magneto helmet, if you are familiar with the terminology. That is: it protects me from psychic attacks. Now, am I in danger of having mutants exercise their telepathic powers against me? No, no, of course not. That's the layman's version. Rather, I am <i>overbearingly </i>perceptive of where <i>all </i>attention is being directed at <i>all </i>times. Others, too, have this perception -- albeit instinctively, and to a much lesser degree. As such, there is a <i>vast, </i>causative <i>network </i>of interconnected attention spans invisibly permeating <i>all </i>human interactions. For each of these instances of attention, then, there is an <i>opportunity. </i>There is an opportunity to <i>capitalize </i>on the <i>effects </i>of this attention, and, just the same, there is a corresponding <i>likelihood, </i>or a <i>possibility, </i>that <i>actions, </i>whether mine or another person's, will then be exercised, accordingly, in order to make use of these aforementioned avenues of opportunity. All of this is happening in plain sight, <i>all the time, </i>you see. Most of it remains below the threshold of the typical person's subconsciousness, as you might expect, but it is all very, very real. In any case, yeah. I wear the hood. Rather perpetually, I wear it. I wear it so I can guard both my eyes and my peripheral vision, and, thus, in <i>doing </i>so, dictate the <i>degree </i>of <i>chance </i>those around me will act in consideration of my <i>own </i>attention span. Essentially, the hood mitigates the risk my attention span will be polluted by factors outside my control, helping ensure my agency over my own actions is not compromised. That is: it protects me from psychic attacks. Have you ever wondered why magicians and wizards are so frequently depicted wearing hoods and cloaks? Well, guess what. Now you know.<br>
<br></div>I smoked a couple of cigarettes yesterday. I smoked a couple more today, too. I don't know what the <i>fuck </i>is <i>wrong </i>with me. Really, it's not like it's even especially difficult to abstain from smoking them. It's not! But it is <i>moderately </i>difficult, because I <i>do </i>experience <i>some </i>inconvenience so long as I want to smoke one and continue to abstain. Now, that shouldn't be a big deal, and it isn't. I mean, I experience inconvenience all the time! When I'm hungry, I experience it. When the weather is too warm, I experience it. It doesn't <i>matter </i>that I experience it. It goes away! Sometimes it's even <i>useful </i>that I experience it! I know these things. I know them well, and I feel like, <i>by </i>knowing them, they should <i>definitely </i>have <i>some </i>persuasive power over me. I <i>want </i>them to. Really, I do. But there's this <i>other thing. </i>This other thing, it makes me <i>want </i>to experience inconvenience, because I <i>care </i>to. It really makes all the difference in the whole world. But this other thing is just <i>beyond </i>me: I <i>can't </i>doctor it into my mind, by my <i>own </i>power, no matter <i>what </i>I do.<br>
<br>granted, sometimes I <i>have </i>this thing. By the grace of God <i>alone, </i>I have it! And I <i>know </i>it's not a toy. It's the most valuable gift that even <i>exists. </i>Truly, it is. And I know that, when I have it, I'm supposed to <i>use </i>it. It's <i>not </i>a toy. I <i>shouldn't </i>play with it; I should <i>use </i>it. I know this <i>so well. </i>But it's fucking <i>ridiculous, </i>man. I just keep using it <i>wrong. </i>For years, dude. For years, I have been granted this <i>thing </i>on what has proved to be an entirely provisional basis. Each time, I use it wrong. Then, <i>poof. </i>It's taken away, like nothing even happened. <i>Each time, </i>it's like this. And then, <i>each time, </i>I undergo this lengthy, tedious, and <i>profoundly demoralizing </i>period where I am utterly degenerated by the absence of this gift. I am reduced to a point of <i>total </i>helplessness, being made <i>acutely aware </i>of the <i>absolute necessity </i>of the gift, and I fucking <i>beg </i>for the gift. For <i>years </i>I have repeated this <i>same, exact </i>Groundhog Day <i>bullshit, </i>being altogether immune even to the luxury of believing something of a <i>greater variety </i>is even <i>happening </i>to me. What the <i>fuck </i>is <i>wrong </i>with me? I need a cigarette. Fuckin' hell, dude.<br>
<br></div>I have a camera again. Ever since this recently acquiring my new phone, I have one. I like taking pictures. I like telling stories with pictures. But I don't have a USB cable I can use to transfer pictures from my phone to a computer, and I also don't think I'm even able to access my email from my phone, due to some silly incompatibility between Gmail's login authentication page and my phone's crappy web browser. This is not a veiled request you invite me to send you text messages. I'm just telling you a story in some futile attempt to offset my own frustration with myself and my behavior.<br>
<br></div>I dunno. I think that about does it for me at this present moment. I'm fine. Really. Nothing else to report. Talk soon.<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></font></div></table></table><hr><table class=message width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tbody><tr><td><font size=-1><b>&lt;φ3 </b>&lt;aphemix@gmail.com&gt;</font><td align=right><font size=-1>Thu, Apr 24, 2014 at 7:16 PM</font><tr><td colspan=2><font class=recipient size=-1><div>To: Rebekah R &lt;artismyjoy333@yahoo.com&gt;</div></font><tr><td colspan=2><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=12 border=0><tbody><tr><td><div style=overflow:hidden><font size=-1><div dir=ltr>meow,<br><br>I am doing well. I came to my senses almost immediately after writing this last email, having sufficiently addressed some necessary thought content in the course of writing it. Don't really feel like getting into detail right this second -- or, more specifically, don't really feel like devising a means of <i>presenting </i>the detail in such a way that reading about it is interesting or worthwhile, because I'm kinda just not in a writing mood, and who cares. But hey, long story short, I'm done with the cigarette nonsense, I know what's up, I'm cool, I know what I'm doing, and blah blah blah. I don't believe I deserve any particular credit for this, but maybe you will be pleased, just as I am, that I'm not being any bigger of a stupid asshole, at least. So yeah, that's cool.<br>
<br>I found one of those very USB cables I was hoping I would come across, completely randomly, this morning. I expected to be able to transfer my pictures from my phone to my laptop with it, and even took a completely redundant picture of the cord in my hand in preparation of my doing precisely that, but, for some yet indeterminate reason, I am only able to charge my phone rather than transfer data from the phone with the cable. I am going to have to perform a few more tests before I can even be certain how annoyed I am about all of this.<br>
<br>I've been feeling kinda impatient all day. Nothing serious, but enough that I notice. My refraining from smoking cigarettes remains easy, and for that I am <i>very, very thankful, </i>but I can definitely tell my mindstate is at least somewhat affected, as though I woke up on the wrong side of the figurative bed or something. The absolute most this has resulted in so far is, for one, my having briefly gotten short with maybe two people total throughout the day, and, two, my not automatically being in a good, writing mood until a few minutes following my sitting down and starting to type you this letter. So, no big deal, really. We'll see if tomorrow proves to be better or worse in this regard, but I am going to wager the worst of my symptoms are already over. (I love making bets in favor of my own competence. I am an asshole.)<br>

Thank god I didn't break the concrete though. Then drove from Lebanon towards Lancaster, realized I had about 40 minutes to kill, and stopped at my mom's place in manheim. thought my sister was home, went in, and turns out she was not. so I took a nap out in my car for about 15 minutes, with the key in the ignition to charge my phone that was almost dead. went to start my car and the battery was dead. AH! and I had 15 minutes. scrambled and fetched neighbors to jump my car. got that done in
right about 15 minutes. wooh! Got to birthday party fine, that went well. Home at 8, passed out for an hour, left the house again at 10 after scrambling to get dressed into henna artist-ish clothes and get the right supplies together.

I'm in the middle of the city where an anime convention has been going<br>
on all weekend. There are scantily-clad women in fantasy costumes all<br>
over the streets. I am surrounded. The environment is rather carnal<br>
and rave-like.<br>
<br>
right next to me, a lady street preacher is going craaaazy. Has been<br>
for the past hour. I respect her a lot. She is speaking some very<br>
vital and commendable things, with astonishing enthusiasm and tireless<br>
persistence. She sounds radical in contrast to how the regular person<br>
on the street is acting, but she is awesome. She is getting 'er the<br>
fuck done.<br>
<br>
meanwhile, my homeless friends are congregating opposite her. My k2<br>
friends, that is -- the demons I walk among. Frenzied battle cries of<br>
''hail Satan'' abound. Many of these young people walking around are<br>
being enticed into acting in like manner. They are evangelizing to<br>
each other. They are growing in number and antagonizing the woman more<br>
and more overtly. For the past hour this situation has been<br>
progressing ever further. I am in a literal war zone.<br>
<br>
I finally got into my Gmail from my phone. I'll be around.<br>

I am sitting on a toilet in the Marriott's bathroom, on my laptop. My phone's internet functionality remains grossly insufficient for my needs. I am making overt typing noises while people around me are shitting. I am not calm at all.<br>
<br>I feel aimless. I am looking forward to nothing. I want to make something up just so I can look forward to it. Maybe my brother will want to hang out today -- even though I already got in touch with him earlier today and he sounded about as disinterested as a person could possibly be. You would think I would be better at occupying myself and enduring the inevitable downtime of my days with as long as I've been on the street.<br>
<br>I keep hanging out with this girl I mentioned. Scarlett is her name. I enjoy her company, and, I mean, I definitely like her, but I can tell she expects something out of me, and that there is an unmistakable element of progression to our interactions, as though they are inherently predisposed to lead somewhere. I'm really confused, and it's making me really depressed. I want to just dodge her completely, as if in total rejection of even the suggestion she could have any place in my life. My head is all fucked up. My head is all fucked up and I don't even want to address it or give it a break because I feel like shit is supposed to be fucked up in real life, and I need to hold down the fort, because if my head doesn't continue to reflect how fucked up the shit is, there's not going to be anything left that corresponds to the reality that shit is fucked up, and it's just going to pass, even when it's not supposed to. That's what I feel like. Man it fuckin' blows. But I will not smoke a cigarette.<br>

My mind is running a million miles a minute in place. Like a determined hamster in a wheel. Restless. My dad caught me sitting on the couch just rocking back and forth unaware of it. Makes me feel pretty whacked out. I don't know if this has something to do with my hormones since I quit the shot. Or if its from what I ate today. Either way something triggered me to become incredibly anxious. My money is on the hormones. Familiar feelings are coming back that I'm not a fan of. Feelings that paralyze me and keep me from being productive. I hope it's just a night. I'm working out with friends tomorrow morning, so if I'm still anxious when I wake up, the workout should get rid of it.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Oh, I was able to set up to do face painting on a cruise over Christmas. I'm working, but I'm still paying a little to be on the cruise. But hey, it will be my first time going outside the United States. Or traveling so far on my own. It will be a value free. So something weird happened today. I was just about to print out my application for a passport and my computer shut off at the exact moment I went to print it out. It had unplugged just slightly from the battery on the cord, but not enough for me to noticd. So I went to the library without, and they have forms already there that I could have for free to fill out. Also when I was told how much it cost for the passport, I counted out all the scrambled cash I had from this past weekend and it was the EXACT amount I needed. It was a little freaky. Like I know that doesn't sound super crazy, but I feel like the universe is making the path a clear easy one for me, even down to the tiny things
like that. I feel blessed and taken care of by things I don't see. </p>
<p dir=ltr>Kind of makes me feel better already to make mention of that. I live in a fast paced world where there's all this pressure and worry weighing down on me. But I am being watched over and guided toward things to fill the bigger picture that I can't see half the time.</p>
<p dir=ltr>The anxiety has me drained. Soon time to fall asleep.</p>
<p dir=ltr>And hi. Have a lovely evening. Catch you on the flip side. </p><font color=#550055>

I've done a lot of this same thing, myself, of course. It proved very valuable, as I've mentioned, in encouraging me to do what I already wanted to do. It seems it has quite the same effect in your case, also -- which I can't say surprises me at all.<br>
<br>among my prayers, I have prayed consistently that you would be made perfect, and that you would want for absolutely nothing. I have perhaps prayed more sincerely for this than I have for any other thing, and have deliberately dedicated my instances of sincerity to precisely this, in order that I would know my sincerity and that it would likewise be put to use. I am royalty in my Lord's kingdom -- more precisely, my <i>sincerity </i>is royalty in my Lord's kingdom, and the Lord will do precisely as my sincerity asks. Make no mistake: you are under a seal of spiritual protection. These matters are altogether resolved. You are being watched over and guided toward things to fulfill the bigger picture, whether you can see it half the time or not. And you are welcome to follow the clear and easy path of your astrological universe in the meantime if you want to, as you are sealed, and nothing of this world will harm you. I promise I do not say these things lightly.<br>
<br>if your anxiety is made to persist this morning, I would like you to know that I am also anxious. I prayed, specifically, last night, that I would suffer particular difficulty, but that, <i>with </i>that difficulty, I would develop discipline to seek the Lord, appreciate him, and explicitly do his will in <i>spite </i>of the effects of my difficulties. I know that I am unskilled in this discipline, but I also expect it is appropriate at this present time that I address this issue of mine in particular, and I will. My heart is sincere in this matter, and my desire in prayer is likewise sincere, and the Lord will likewise do as I ask. Know these things.<br>
<br>tell me about your true self. What do you think she would do if the world did not require she work so hard?<br><br>I am late for my breakfast.

Am I late? I'm late.<br><br>I'm smoking a cigarette as I type this. Every day for the past three days I have smoked them. I have appointed myself a time to smoke them, and I have erected myself psychological avenues through which I could better enable myself to smoke them. Already, I have conditioned myself to such a point that my experience of my comfortable morning is lacking and incomplete if I do not smoke them. I am still committed to quitting, if you can believe such a preposterous thing, but in evaluating the dire nature of my failure, my anticipation of my own inability is so compounded that, in expectation of my weakness, I have already all but resigned myself in my mind to constrain my further attempts for another entire day's time, planning that, rather than struggle in the present moment to hold to my commitment for its own sake, I will return to the street with a replenished allotment of food stamps, on Tuesday, and, instead, use my discontent with my environment and my ready access to munchies alike as crutches. Do you hear me? Crutches! I am a <i>mess. </i>I am <i>disgusted </i>with myself. This is ridiculous. I am unfit to serve the Lord.<br>
<br></div>when I first committed to quitting, I knew what I had to do. I had determined, from my brief lapses in quitting k2, that my devising mere <i>reasons, </i>and quitting on the merit of those devised reasons alone, was <i>not </i>a sufficient means of constraining my own behavior. I <i>tried </i>doing it this way<i>, </i>at <i>first, </i>but it was quickly made clear to me that, should I <i>choose, </i>I may engineer circumstances, at <i>any time, </i>to <i>such </i>an extent that <i>any </i>reasons I devise are <i>made </i>inapplicable to my situation. I <i>knew </i>this! I <i>still </i>know it! I did <i>not </i>waste that lesson. This lesson served its good purpose: it contextualized and reinforced to me the necessity of anchoring my actions by the Lord, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. Amen.<br>
<br></div>upon first receiving my dream about you, I was confused. I was unsure of its correct interpretation. At once, I was convinced it was warning me of a danger very much like the one I have just described: I believed it was meant to tell me that, in the event I would conform myself to <i>your </i>expectations, anchoring my actions by their adherence to <i>your </i>standards<i>, </i>they would fall short, they would not attain to perfection, and my pursuit of the Lord would be compromised. I took this, at first, with great difficulty, believing the Lord had showed me why I must abandon my hope in you. Still, I <i>begged </i>in prayer. <i>Desperately, </i>I pleaded, asking earnestly that there may be some way these matters might be reconciled.<br>
<br>I believed, at this time, that I was faced with a very straightforward choice: one between my pursuit of you and my pursuit of my God himself. Now, I love my God. Without him, I am nothing. I <i>know </i>that his will for me is pure. I know that my own righteousness is but filthy rags in his sight, and, God willing, may my own wants count as <i>garbage </i>that I may gain Christ. Truly, I tell you these things. Indeed, knowing them, I conceded to do as I must. Yet <i>despite </i>them, I asked in prayer.<br>
<br></div>the next day after I awoke, a friend I mentor in Christ asked me a curious question. She asked, in poor understanding, why Jesus never had children, supposing to herself that his abstinence could be construed as selfishness. Interestingly, in seeking to answer her with Scripture, my mind fell immediately upon a familiar set of verses that, though, by <i>implication, </i>served <i>also </i>to address her <i>own </i>inquiry to perfect satisfaction, acted <i>primarily </i>to warn against the danger of having one's interests divided from the Lord, not generally, but <i>specifically, </i>and by his own commitment to a <i>spouse. </i>In other words, incidentally, and by an altogether unrelated encounter, I was directed to an unambiguous teaching that spoke explicitly unto my own concerns. I took this very seriously: an unmistakable manilla envelope, it was. Reading onward, then, and observing the context of the verses, I saw that this warning overtly distinguished itself not as the Lord's command, but merely as sound advice for the right guidance of a believer. Furthermore, it was clarified that, in the event that poor self-control poses a greater threat than the division from the Lord by a commitment to a spouse, it is even <i>better </i>to take a spouse. As a <i>crutch. </i>To my very heart, these things spoke. And by these understandings, my interpretation of my dream cohered and evolved.<br>
<br></div>my hope in you was renewed by these things, and I was emboldened. I <i>knew </i>I would pursue the Lord. I <i>knew </i>these matters were resolved. I knew I would quit smoking cigarettes, too, and, as such, I even openly volunteered <i>you </i>the privilege of being the <i>crutch </i>with which I successfully did this -- expecting, by my understanding of the pattern I had so far seen, that this very course of action would indeed be the avenue through which these things would be made to occur. But my understanding was not yet complete. I was yet weak. In my weakness, I made two grave and interrelated mistakes: I, first and foremost, was not considerate of you and your position, even in knowing completely it has been extraordinarily different from my own. I allowed myself to impose upon you, expecting that, even through my doing so, resolution would come. In conjunction with this, I also relied inappropriately on my crutch, which was my construction of these things in my mind. Rather than use my crutch to walk in the Lord, I had determined to use it as a means of walking lame, anchoring my standards not by the strength of my uprightness, but by the resiliency of the crutch. My boldness depended wrongly on my expectations, and, as such, my expectations were rightly dashed. My hope in the perfect Lord had been misplaced in the strength of a crutch, and I fell lame to the ground: I smoked cigarettes. My crutch was of insufficient strength to deliver me from cigarettes. But my understanding was not yet complete.<br>
<br></div>ever since being shown the verses pertaining to my vision, being sufficiently convinced the Lord has not commanded me away from you, I have set my mind and hoped. I am yet weak, and, as such, I am susceptible to being compromised by my own weakness. This compromise may manifest as anything from my confusion, to my irresolution, to my impatience, and to my untempered conduct -- all of which are interrelated symptoms of the same condition, and by which my hope and my mind alike may waver. Just the same, I am made without compromise, being freed entirely from my condition, by my proximity to the Lord. Indeed, I have wavered, but, just as I have said, in the instances of my greatest sincerity, my understanding is complete, and I have prayed thusly: may we each be made perfect. May we each want for absolutely nothing. May we each walk wholly upright in the Lord, in <i>total </i>newness of life, that we each, by the other's failures, may <i>never </i>be compromised, and, in our perfection, may <i>never </i>divide the other even <i>marginally </i>from the <i>complete </i>glory of the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, that is my prayer. It is for these very same things that my God humbled himself as a man and became obedient even to the point of death, and it is for these very same things that I will both fall lame to the ground and walk. Amen.<br>

<br>I don't roll my eyes at your horoscope, either. I am not one to scoff or dismiss. I just <i>warn </i>you. I just use the subject as a means of telling you things, really. Why waste it? Your reading does sound rather poignant today. I hope you feel better.<br>
<br>that story about your mom is horrible. I really hurt for that girl in the box. Even to an extent that I am surprised.<br><br>when I was in fifth grade or so, I found a printed copy of an online conversation between my mom and an unknown man, which had accidentally been placed among my own belongings. When I read it, it became clear to me that my mom was having an affair with the man, and that she had no regard at all for my father as she did so. I had never had much of any relationship with my mom, even from my childhood. I had always loved my father immensely, as well, and I knew that these things were being kept concealed from my father. But in my judgment, in consideration of my family, I determined it best that I kept these things from my father.<br>
<br>for years, I kept these things to myself. Even in light of encountering further evidence of what I had learned, I kept them. Even as my mom proceeded to warp and abuse my family by her progressively worsening and more antisocial pathology, I kept them. As a young teenager, though, I saw my dad toiling away ever harder for his family, even at the cost of his dissociation from his family, and it hurt me, and I broke. I saw what I knew was surely his impaired judgment, and I saw what I knew was surely its unnecessary cost, and I <i>had </i>to tell him. So I told him. As carefully as I could tell him, I told him. He received me, as I shared these things. He understood, and we commiserated together. He revealed to me, then: he told me he was already aware of what I had told him. He had discovered it incidentally, himself, some months previous. My mom even knew he was aware, and yet <i>persisted. </i>He just chose to respond how he chose to respond -- as though she hadn't done anything to him at all.<br>
<br>no sooner than did begin my newly adult relationship with my father, the Lord took him. He died very shortly after we began to relate on these terms, and I lost him while I was arguably closer to him than ever. He died of a heart attack, which he had while the two of us were alone. He instructed me, in his last words, that I should love my mother and be good to her, but I did not listen to him. In the years following, my mom warped my family immensely. She did enormous damage to my family, and I did not love her or do good to her at all. She moved her pool boy into our home, they had a daughter, and they were eventually married. To this day they are married, and, to this day, she continues to do enormous damage to my family, including to the new additions to my family. They are a mess, the lot of them. He is not like my father.<br>
<br></div>I have a little girl in the box, too, you see. She hurts. But my dad had the right idea. It took me a really long time to understand just how he had the right idea. It took a lot of difficulty -- even more than I have shared with you in all of these skyscrapers of emails. But I understand. Just the same as my father sacrificed himself, even to the extent that he sacrificed his own proximity to his family, so too does the Lord sacrifice himself, even to the extent that he sacrificed his own proximity to my family after my father passed.

Bluhhhh. So anxious. SO anxious. Maybe I should take a break from coffee. Easier said than done. And not that I think caffeine is the cause of my anxiety. But it sure doesn't help.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Yesterday I ended up giving in to my oreo idea. So I failed there. I had 3 oreos today with my coffee too. G D it Bekah! </p>
<p dir=ltr>But today I don't have an appetite. That I am used to. No appetite for anything other than very carby sweet things, and even then not ambitious to eat. I had a tiny bowl of mac and cheese for breakfast. Because dad had just made it. And 3 oreos. And 3 cups of coffee, one from starbucks when I went to drop off flyers there. Now I'm feeling sick so .. ramen. And then bed right after. I think I need to go buy more guac and hummus. I'm always in the mood for them.</p>
<p dir=ltr>We're moving soon. Staying in the area, but just ready for a better living situation. The house we checked out today is the one I think. Just need the peeps to get the application review process over with. We could be moved into there within the month. Who knows. I'm nervous about it.</p>
<p dir=ltr>Nervous about business too. I think too much, I think too much, I think too much. Too much thought, not nearly as much action!</p>
<p dir=ltr>Ffff. And philly guy. His face is tattood on the backs of my eyelids. And I'm reminded how crippling it is when I let myself want someone this much. Just like how I was with Armando. I feel needy. But then I don't. I swear I am two people in one body. I'm in constant opposition with myself it seems. Two halves of me struggling to overpower each other. One is a restless doubter and one is a restless dreamer. They do nothing but nitpick at each other. One day, I doubt everything. I doubt my competence, my life, my future; I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. The next day every moment is a golden opportunity, and I'm surrounded by beauty and meaning and hopefulness. They take turns drowning each other out.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm going to eat ramen and fall asleep. Oh mu god I love sleep. I don't know what I would do without it. I am in such a magical place when I am unconscious.</p>

Hello.)<br><br></div><div>you're very good at writing. Have you just started to use the semicolon? It took me a little while to learn to use it correctly, myself. For reference, there are two instances in which it is correct to use it. One is when each sentence fragment on each side of the semicolon may also suffice as a complete sentence, in place of a period. The other is while iterating multiple things, as though listing, when each listed item would otherwise by separated with a comma, in place of those commas -- but, particularly, in the instances when some items among those listed, themselves, rely on commas to be described, which would otherwise disrupt or obscure the continuity of the sentence. You used yours correctly, so you know. I just wanted to tell you.<br>
<br></div><div>I sometimes use my own with a bit of artistic license: I will use them to separate sentence fragments that do not qualify technically as complete sentences. I do this with respect to the similar manner in which I will sometimes phrase incomplete sentences as though they are sentences: I consider the elements that qualify the fragments as complete sentences to be <i>implied </i>by the context of the sentences, and, when I separate such fragments with a semicolon, I consider this to be the case equally on each side of the semicolon. Very hard mode! <i>For professionals only. </i><br>
<br></div><div>that thing I do, where I will disrupt the continuity of a sentence with a series of dashes, only to interject a thought that is related, but that is incongruous with the syntax of the sentence -- these are called <i>anacolutha. </i>Why do I know this? Because I accidentally stumbled upon the word while browsing dictionary definitions for what was most likely recreation, and I committed it to memory, that's why. Now you know.<br>

<p dir=ltr>I have indulged in semicolons for... idk, since 10th grade. That wasn't that long ago. That was 5 years ago. Creepy, huh? But anyways, I like them. They's some purdy swell punctuation! </p>
<p dir=ltr>I'm less anxious right now. Ready to pass out. I jogged all of half a block and exhausted myself. Haha.. ha... hehhh. That's kinda pathetic. But anyways, it rid me of all nervous energy.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I also only had half a cup of coffee today.</p>
<p dir=ltr>I did stress while accounting and realizing how little profit I'm making. Not enough to live off of. But hey. I'm not stressed right now. I don't give two fucks! </p>

The one that I told I wasn't interested in him because he was too nice, that I then felt like an ass about and quit dating altogether. The one that sent me an apology text a month later that I didn't respond to. He sent me another text a week ago asking if we could still be friends. And I said yeah. But now he wants to hang out. I don't hang out with my friends! Ahhhhh! There I go being unintentionally misleading. And I know how this works most of the time. If a guy wants to hang out one on one, unless you already have a well-established brotherly-sisterly type relationship, that means he still thinks there
is the hope of being more than friends. And there is not a chance of being more than friends! I don't want to deal with more awkward as hell moments. I just don't. I'm tired of it. I want to think well of the guy, and if I bump into him, cool, hi buddy, how are you? and if we have mutual friends and there's a gathering/party, that's cool too! Happy to chill and converse in that scenario! You know what I mean? I want to be casual as hell about that kind of thing. I don't want to TRY when there isn't a reason to try, or when it would be sending a mixed message to actually try/plan the whole hanging out thing. So... blarg. If he asks again, I'll hang out once. And lay it out that I'm not a social creature that wants to hang out, and that I have a love interest, so there is no reason to hang out with me. That should do it right? Or should I just send him another long-ass text expressing this that way the situation can be dealt with from
afar?</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">So excited about moving.

I did. haha. A random guy I was texting back when I had an okcupid account. and here and there we've had little exchanges.

Goodnight. :-)" &nbsp; &nbsp;Woke up at 2 in the morning from my phone buzzing,and it was a text from him leading me to believe he was overdosing to commit suicide. "I'm sorry I killed myself, but I'm not going to have a good fucking life. Goodbye." &nbsp; Something like that. Freaking tool move. I nearly called the cops on him, and i don't even know where the guy lives. But he was fine. Being an ass because he was drunk, but he was fine. And I'm done talking to him now. That is some seriously petty attention-getting shit. Not fun to wake up to texts like that. Especially since his name starts with a J and the other guy's name starts with a J, and I was groggy, so i
didn't read the name correctly right away. So I was just like "God dammit. This is not happening right now. I am not one of the factors causing Mr. Nice Guy to commit suicide." &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank god it was just the other one being a drunk ass-hat.</div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,'Lucida Grande',sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal">I haven't had coffee at all yet today.
