I had a dream last night that my father was somehow alive in this house

so there was a point, after I had already understood that he was alive, already having the knowledge

where my mom burst into this room and started acting ignorant toward me, really mean-spirited, really trivial, being evil about nothing

so I was disrespectful of her and I responded in kind, basically, I just wanted her out of my face

but suddenly I remembered again that my dad was alive, I was partially lucid and I remembered

I looked past my mom as she left out my door and I could see my dad right there behind her, outside my room, across the deck outside my room, in the doorway of the main house, it was broad daylight outside

and I immediately started crying, like, bawling, knowing that I had hurt him by how I had acted toward his wife

and I ran toward him, crying, apologetic, and the first thing I could think to say or do, as an apology

was to basically assure him of the situation, debrief him, and my assurance said that, y'know, it's okay, my mom needs Jesus Christ, that's why things are this way, but it's okay, because he's here

and I was talking about myself when I said he was here, I was basically saying, look, he's taking care of me, he's going to work through me eventually, it's cool, your wife is cool

and suddenly I realized how desperately I had to tell my dad that I was a Christian, how we had never talked about it at all, how he would know what it meant for his wife, how happy it would make him that his SON was okay, how he would truly understand for real

so I looked right into his eyes and I told him, and it was like looking into a real person's eyes, and we embraced each other, and it was like embracing and being embraced by a real person, just bawling

and a second later, he makes some little side note, I can't picture the exact words, but he says, laughing, messing with me, something to the effect of

hey, on the subject, you kinda need a shower there buddy

and he's saying it in response to my hugging him, to my being so close to him, to my having his face right there against my body

but he knows he's clever when he says this

so I think to myself, again partially lucid, even recognizing the lightheartedness and the joke, trying to understand what it was and roll with it, just like real life

and I say, hey, you're right, I haven't taken a shower in many days, that's just a fact

and I start to kinda defend myself or justify myself, in my lucidity coming up with excuse, and I start saying,

hey, you know I have no sense of smell, right

in fact I was even born without one

and I was going along, saying this, knowing it just felt like a fitting thing to say, as I had not seen my dad for so long -- I was so sure I hadn't even seen him one time since I first started saying this to people

and I realized, wait, I was born without one, this doesn't make any sense, why am I trying to teach him this, why would he not know this, he's my father

but he just kept looking at me, not mad, loving me, knowing he was clever, joking, something like that -- I think it was a feeling at this point, not strictly visual imagery

and suddenly I was awake

and I knew I had to get up and write down all these things, and I even knew I had to analyze them, suspecting right away that I had received this dream from the Lord

so, y'know, I prayed, something I don't usually do right when I wake up, and I got up, and I wrote, and I analyzed

and a few things occurred to me pretty plainly, pretty clearly

first of all, right away, I remembered that I had another dream, some years ago, where my dad was also alive, a member of my family, as though it were normal

I even told you about it when it happened, because it really bugged me out, although I can't find our conversation about it, which sucks, because I barely remember it

however, to give you an idea,

my mom and my dad were together, in my main house, and my mom was kinda using my dad as an instrument, acting horribly toward me while he was compliant, very uncharacteristic of him

and I said something to him about Jesus Christ, introduced Christ into the exchange somehow, and my dad did not respond in the way that I would expect him to respond

I believe he even tried to suggest I was crazy, going overboard, acting inappropriately

and I became lucid in this dream, also, as a result of these things, and it was clear that my father was an imposter, it was clearly some demonic trick

I retreated to my separate room, and I passed over this deck outside that separates my house from my room, same deck I mentioned, but this time it was the pitch black of night

and it was right beyond this deck that I saw that UFO thing those years ago, those crazy lights in my backyard

so in my dream I was immediately wary, spiritually wary of this area, just like I would be in real life, for that matter, as my memory of this thing has always scared me since then

and I even saw, at this point, some zombie, some walking corpse or something, in my backyard, in that area, which confirmed to me the demonic nature of this experience

and that's pretty much all I remember of the dream any more

so okay, it immediately occured to me

there were clear parallels between these two dreams, even significant parallels of meaning that could not be faked by the devil

and as a whole, they communicated a message

the message, basically, is that, okay, back in the day, I was in this different position, I had the wrong family in my house, my "dad" was not my "dad," something demonic was upon me

but I recognized it, I retreated, I dealt with it, it passed

and now, years later, well, my mom is still my mom, but I am rightly separate in my room, my real "dad" occupies my house, I did not even enter the house except through him

and it was broad daylight, and I could see everything, and I know that my love for him drew me to that house, and I know that we interacted rightly

I even see the clear parallels to my relationship with God, clear parallels to these mechanisms through which I interact with God in real life

and the sense of smell thing, well, that......was a freakin' intense joke that deserves all my respect

he told me I need a shower, which I do.....I am in sin, I am not yet right, but he laughs, he's not mad, he knows, he's my dad

I told him I was born with no sense of smell, which I was......I am a psychopath, evil is truly my native behavior, the smell doesn't even bother me except by its effect on other people

yet when I told him these things, it was ridiculous, and the way it was ridiculous is such a clever joke

because of course my heavenly Father knows these things, first of all, of course he knows, it was by him that I was born, he has been with me since the beginning

and of course my earthly father knows these things, he was with me in the beginning also

but I realized, the reason it occurred to me as a fitting thing to say, the reason my radar picked it up, I was so sure I had never brought this up to my dad before

is because I would only say these things, not because they were true, but to emphasize my idiosyncrasy, to show my quirkiness, to be interesting to others, to seduce others

to be a psychopath in the first place, basically

and wow I must say

even the least of these in the kingdom of heaven is greater than the funniest and the most clever on earth

because even in all my ability and cleverness I could never have come up with a joke so perfect and so fitting by my own mind

the end.
