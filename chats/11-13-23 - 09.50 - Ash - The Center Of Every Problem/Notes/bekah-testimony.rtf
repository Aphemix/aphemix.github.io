{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2512;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\lang9\f0\fs22 I was blessed to grow up in a Christian home with loving parents. I was taught from an early age that Jesus loves me and died for me. I longed for a relationship with Him, but I did not believe I was guilty of sin that would require something so serious as His death on the cross. I believed I was an intrinsically good person with right judgment. I took it very seriously and my parents could tell you how eager I was to be an adult so I could have more freedoms and respect.\par
I accepted Christ at a young age with my limited understanding. I remember believing things like \ldblquote Christians are good people and anybody else is not good or trustworthy at all\rdblquote  and I thought \ldblquote I am on your side Jesus; I'm glad you died for the people that need you, like to murderers and robbers.\rdblquote  \par
My pride in my own goodness and my own capability to understand kept me confused. As I went through my early teen years, I moved further and further from Christianity. It appeared more and more unattractive to me. I had one foot in, thinking \ldblquote Jesus loves me and he is good\rdblquote  and my other foot out with all my doubt in Him and my pride in myself. I did not want to believe that people would be sent to hell just because they did not know Jesus, because I knew a lot of people don't know him based on their circumstances. I reasoned a good God who loves them could not possibly forsake them; So I doubted Jesus as the only way for salvation. I thought he was an awesome guy but Christianity must have been getting it wrong somehow. I remember in my early teen years at church, when we did communion, being convicted not to partake of it, because it was wrong to partake if I did not accept Him with all my heart. I was very conflicted about it, because I did not know and love Jesus the way I could see others knew and loved Him.\par
I looked at all the faults of the religion of Christianity; I thought of the torture and War done in the name of Christianity, how it was a tool for a patriarchal society upholding men's power while shaming and quieting women, how narrow and exclusive it appeared. I became ashamed to even identify as a Christian, because I decided the group as a whole had gotten it wrong. I did not want to be a part of that; I did not want to take on that label. I became very particular about labels. Labels were a big part of prejudice and hate. Instead, I decided I am just spiritual. I felt that my journey to know who God is and what good is only required my own heart, experiences, and discernment; no book, no social influence, no one else telling me what the truth is, no brainwashing. I believed I could just let my heart can lead the way; and it wouldn't lead me wrong. and so I adopted many beliefs and behaviors and pieces of my identity that felt good to me. Things that passed the testing of my own intuition.\par
At age 19 I went from any sort of lukewarm feeling of Christianity to completely renouncing my faith in Jesus as my savior, because I believed I did not need a savior. And I had met plenty of great people who did not know Jesus, who I reasoned did not need a savior. So, I embraced beliefs that went along with my feelings that nobody needs a savior, since we are all truly good in our core. Any belief about love and kindness was good and any belief about guilt and condemnation was hateful and wrong, and therefore, not true. So here I was rejecting the true God and over time adding more and more beliefs to myself based on what felt good to my heart. My compilation of beliefs included believing in an infinite Universe with infinite dimensions in which our imaginations create physical things in other dimensions and in which every decision we make splits us off into a different path in a different dimension to live out our life in that form, meaning we have infinite possibilities and from our present place in our Earthly bodies we can't quite see them yet. I believed in law of attraction which is essentially faith in the universe to give you something you want if you just call it to yourself. I believed in following signs based on intuition, and that this would lead me down the best path and draws Success and happiness and abundance to my life. I believed that the purpose of all life in the universe was experience, and that the most ideal experience was happiness and abundance. In the end we are all pieces of God, and God just wants to experience himself. Each time we die we would be connected to the rest of the pieces that make up the God of the universe and know everything and then we go back maybe in an elevated life of connection to the source or maybe in a harder life with the goal to elevate other souls and their vibrations based on our own Souls skill level and accumulated High vibration. In this way I could justify good and evil, light and darkness, joy and despair, As necessary experiences, but never ever leading to Eternal separation or damnation. All were one in this God universe. I thought this picture was so good, and correct. It explained terrible things in the world as just low vibration, something that the collective God was experiencing and all part of the plan, that it would eventually grow to reach a higher vibration, and not to worry. beliefs like this I would expand on and daydream about. Belief In The Law of Attraction would reward me and success in my dream career was the main point of my life. To be myself as much as possible in a way that influences other people. I was interested in things such as yoga, reiki, meditation, energy work, and other healing practices. I also had a concept of things such as ancient alien Theory, Spirit guides, And things like that. I definitely was excited to get further into these things but I am glad now that I was just shown what I needed to be shown.  I thought I was seeing the bigger picture than Christianity, and I believed that if a person was spiritually intentional at all, they would be connected with the true source and be able to live out happy and fulfilled lives and that there would also be something beautiful awaiting them after life on Earth no matter what. My experience of separateness from God had been one where I thought I had found fulfillment. I had a false sense of Salvation and spiritual contentment because I believed there were no serious finite consequences to the states of our minds and hearts here on Earth. I had confidence I could die any moment, and I would be totally fine.\par
My head was always foggy and floaty; light as a feather. I was in manic states of happiness 90% of the time. I was a workaholic because my job was following my passions and bringing people happiness and I had to give it everything I had; I was aware to a degree of the consequences, that I was caring more about the work than the personal relationships, that I felt general disconnect, that I felt that I was putting on a face and had to disguise my faults, fears, and history; that nobody knew me. At the same time I took comfort in the safety in nobody knowing me. I was taking charge in keeping low vibration things from entering my life. I had to embrace and project this always happy version of myself to encourage others to do the same, and in the moments of darkness, I hid so nobody could see.\par
So then, I bumped into this guy online, who is now my significant other. We emailed for about a year before I finally agreed to meet him. He is a Christian, with a much darker background before coming to Christ. That is another story on its own. I had started talking to him because I felt he could answer questions I had about what evil is, spurned on by still dealing with the romantic relationship of my past that had hurt me terribly. He started planting seeds about God. I rejected them. They did not align with me. I fell in love with him, but did not want to have anything to do with him; I was afraid to face my feelings and let my guard down to him, especially knowing how much he pushed the gospel. I cut ties for 6 months, to see if my interest would wane. It did not, and he had waited for me. So, we started talking again, and seeing each other. He was witnessing to me, and I was incredibly against him telling me these things. He was insistent that he couldn\rquote t stand to see me angry or uncomfortable by what he said, but even more so, he had no choice but to tell me the truth, because of his love for me. Even if it meant I rejected him.\par
He showed me materials that went over the origins of a lot of my beliefs, and a lot of them are based in Satanism, which branches out into many religions, in different forms that appeal to different kinds of people.  Then he encouraged me to pray to God, and ask Him to show me if He is real. \par
Eventually I started praying sarcastically, feeling very silly about it, as if I was praying to a being that did not exist. Then my prayers gradually went from cynical to angry, and I recognized I had a lot of anger between God and I, if he was real. I began to recognize that He was real, but I did not trust Him. I doubted His goodness, and believed the opposing spiritual forces were the true good because they were the most appealing from my perspective. My heart was on their side. I was at enmity with God in my heart, but I could not deny Him. My prayers were sincerely angry and bitter. I wanted God to explain Himself to me. Why would He put His creation through all this evil and darkness? Why would He put me through all the painful things in my life and put me in a position where I hated Him? Surely He was not good, I thought. Just a big bully in the sky. But acknowledging His presence was the start of my coming back to Him.\par
Each day as I prayed and researched and sorted out my thoughts. My other beliefs were breaking down. I felt very insecure. I didn\rquote t trust my former beliefs, and I didn\rquote t trust God. I stripped down my old beliefs and felt like I had stripped away a false shelter. I was so uncomfortable and hopeless for months and months, because I was so stubborn not to trust God. I prayed for Him to help me genuinely have faith. I wanted it based on tangible facts though. I kept reading and researching, trying to find tangible facts that would get me to believe or disbelieve. I had so much pride in myself, that I was so good that I could judge God and whether or not He was also good. \par
During this time when I began to question my beliefs, when I started to open my heart to Jesus and Yahweh God, I started to experience sleep paralysis and demonic type attacks again at night. Being a bit more mature and aware of the situation, I identified that it was demons who were upset that I was questioning my beliefs that kept me in their hands. In some cases, I felt like I was being pinned down, in one case I felt that I was being dragged along my wall. I would also wake up from nightmares and feel the presence of something evil in my room. Even before my full conversion experience, I called on Jesus to stop the attacks, and they stopped as soon as I could speak His name. I was able to return to rest each time I called on Him, knowing He would protect me in my sleep for the rest of the night. \par
I experienced the power of testimony, when I started watching testimonies on youtube of people converting to Christianity. Muslim to Christ. Atheist to Christ. New Ager to Christ. Jew to Christ. Gay man to Christ. Lesbian to Christ. Buddhist to Christ. They brought me tears. It was so real and in my face how God reaches hearts so powerfully, if only He is let in the gate. And then He works on them, saves and restores and strengthens and protects them. The testimonials were the final driving point. So many other people believed what I believed, and the lies were exposed in their submission to God. They knew my struggle. And I knew Jesus knew my struggle. I knew that my heavenly Father was so loving and patient, letting me blow off my ignorant steam this whole time, like an angry toddler. I surrendered to Jesus, and welcomed Him to enter my life and lead the way. I apologized to God for my pride, and for all the sin I had committed in my pride. I asked Jesus many times with sincerity to come into my heart, and change me, and change my life. I knew I needed Him. I was flooded with thankfulness to God. I knew I didn\rquote t deserve the patience shown to me. It was from a true loving and gracious God. This was March 15th of last year.\par
The day I accepted Him, I felt an incredible relief wash over me. I knew my authority in Christ, that no demon could do harm to me, or shake me, or hold me in terror, with Jesus as my protector. The legal rights were taken from them. They had no power in my life anymore. \par
And then I lived happily ever after! Just kidding, it has been a serious struggle, with a lot more challenges and hardships, but I have Jesus helping me through how to walk in His way, and I know that He is using the trials to give me spiritual growth, and that it is worth it. \par
When I accepted Christ, I died to the flesh in a big way. A lot of the things that had formerly given me a sense of identity and fulfillment didn\rquote t make sense to me anymore. It was scary and confusing, and is not a situation that makes sense to the world. I lost a lot of desires, and gained new desires in a very small amount of time. How was I supposed to explain that to the loved ones in my life, especially the ones that still had similar beliefs to what I did believe? I got rid of a lot of things that mattered to me before. They all just appeared to me as distractions from God. I experienced a lot of separation from former interests. Each day, I felt like letting go of more and more things and practices that I felt were not enriching my relationship with God and my growth in the Spirit with Him. I experienced a lot of loneliness among people, because what I was going through would not make sense to a lot of the people I knew. I wanted to hold on to the Holy spirit was telling me, without offending people, without making people think that I had lost my mind or settled for a lesser belief than theirs. I wanted to forsake my old ways without forsaking people, and it felt like an impossible juggling act. And in a way, it is. I am not responsible for their understanding or reactions. But I can take it to God. He has the perfect plan.\par
The ways God changed my heart are not the same as what He changes for every Christian. He is a personal God, and He works first in the places where we have our greatest weaknesses. God has changed me in ways that brought the power back to my relationship with Him. I deeply questioned all things that brought me a sense of pride in my goodness or my own understanding or my own power. \par
For example, God took away my desire to adorn myself with earrings and makeup, and to feel beautiful as he created me. I also had desire to dress more modestly. These have become stepping stones in my journey.\par
God also touched my heart when it came to giving to people in need. I am not the judge of whether or not they deserve to be given to. Really none of us deserve any of what we get, it is all by grace and blessing. And God says \ldblquote you were given to freely, so freely give.\rdblquote  I had formerly become cold to homeless people, because I thought they were all undeserving manipulative liars. But now I know it is my duty as a follower of Christ to share His love, whether it appears to be deserved or not. Just like Jesus dying on the cross and sacrificing everything for us though we do not deserve it. We are meant to freely give and pursue living with Him on our heart all the time. He gives through us.\par
\par
After just a couple weeks of coming to Christ, a close friend of mine died unexpectedly, and God carried me through it. I was kind of expecting Him to allow me to raise her from the dead. \par
God also helped me to forgive a man whom I had been in a relationship with in my late teen years. After not seeing this person for 4 years, I saw him in passing twice within the same week, and it brought painful feelings up to the surface, mostly shame and anger. I felt that God set that up so I could recognize what was buried deep in my heart, so I could work through it and find forgiveness and healing.  \par
Every day, I feel God\rquote s love, and every day is intense. I have to consciously cling to Him each day, and fight against my carnal nature and pride, and allow the Holy Spirit to lead the way. Each day, each success and each mistake, I am thankful He is using it all to strengthen my faith in Him. There is a lot of my house on the sand still to tear down, and a lot of my new home on the rock to build up. But God is patient and awesome, and I am listening as best as I can to Him. I look forward to getting closer to Him by His grace. Each day, it is my hope that my heart is changed more and more and filled with better desires and more of His wisdom. I intend to continue to pray, read His word, and seek Him as much as I possibly can each new day. Every day is a fight against lies of the world, and embracing the truth in God.\par
I have had my eyes opened to the power of scripture. The Holy Spirit helps tie things together, and speaks to us through the word. The more I read, the more different points of scripture connect like neurons connecting brain cells, and represent truth distributed across layers of physical and spiritual reality. God\rquote s design is so beautiful. \par
