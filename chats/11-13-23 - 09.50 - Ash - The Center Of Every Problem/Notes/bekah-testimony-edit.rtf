I was taught from an early age that Jesus loves me and died for me. I longed for a relationship with Him, but I did not believe I was guilty of sin that would require something so serious as His death on the cross. I believed I was an intrinsically good person with right judgment. I took it very seriously and my parents could tell you how eager I was to be an adult so I could have more freedoms and respect.\line\line\line\line I accepted Christ at a young age with my limited understanding. I remember believing things like \ldblquote Christians are good people and anybody else is not good or trustworthy at all\rdblquote  and I thought \ldblquote I am on your side Jesus; I'm glad you died for the people that need you, like to murderers and robbers.\line\line\line\line\b Teen Years: Doubt, Spiritual Attacks, Sin\b0\strike\line My pride in my own goodness and my own capability to understand kept me confused.\strike0  \highlight1 I had pride in my own goodness, and pride in my own ability to understand, and this kept me confused.\highlight0  As I went through my early teen years, I moved further and further from Christianity. It appeared more and more unattractive to me. I had one foot in, thinking \ldblquote Jesus loves me and he is good\rdblquote  and my other foot out with all my doubt in Him and my pride in myself. \line\line\line\line I did not want to believe that people would be sent to hell just because they did not know Jesus, because I knew a lot of people don't know him based on their circumstances. I reasoned a good God who loves them could not possibly forsake them; So I doubted Jesus as the only way for salvation. I thought he was an awesome guy but Christianity must have been getting it wrong somehow.\line\line\line\line\strike I remember in my early teen years at church, when we did communion, being convicted not to partake of it, because it was wrong to partake if I did not accept Him with all my heart. I was very conflicted about it, because I did not know and love Jesus the way I could see others knew and loved Him. So I stopped taking communion.\strike0\line\line\line\line I looked at all the faults of the religion of Christianity; I thought of the torture and War done in the name of Christianity, how it was a tool for a patriarchal society upholding men's power while shaming and quieting women, how narrow and exclusive it appeared. I became ashamed to even identify as a Christian, because I decided the group as a whole had gotten it wrong. I did not want to be a part of that; I did not want to take on that label. \line\line\line\line I became very particular about labels. Labels were a big part of prejudice and hate. Instead, I decided I am just spiritual. I felt that \strike my journey to know who God is and what good is\strike0  \highlight1 my journey to know God, my journey to understand good,\highlight0  only required my own heart, experiences, and discernment; no book, no social influence, no one else telling me what the truth is, no brainwashing. I believed I could just let my heart lead the way; and it wouldn't lead me wrong. and so I adopted many beliefs and behaviors and pieces of my identity that felt good to me. Things that passed the testing of my own intuition.\line\line\line\line During these teen years, I experienced strange and scary things at night. From nightmares, to sleep paralysis, to my whole bed shaking, or feeling as though I was being grabbed. I was very paranoid of an evil presence manifesting itself in a hidden corner space, and would compulsively check 20 times in 10 minutes, before proceeding to bed, still convinced that it was there. I became sensitive to white noise, \strike so things my family had tried like giving me a noisemaker to calm my nerves didn\rquote t help.\strike0  \highlight1 My family tried giving me a noisemaker to calm my nerves, but\highlight0  I would just hear voices repeating themselves in it. I was even afraid to vacuum my room without a second person present, because of creating the loud noise, I thought I was vulnerable to be attacked or frightened. I was so incredibly paranoid and afraid of attacking spirits. I developed lots of theories on what they were and why they were around me.\line\line\line\line At age 16, I entered into a relationship with a 22 year old. \strike He was a professed Christian, but he clearly was not practicing being a follower of Jesus Christ. That wasn\rquote t a big deal to me of course, because I was not practicing being a follower of Jesus, despite very much being about kindness and \ldblquote goodness.\rdblquote\strike0  I engaged in a great deal of sin and darkness in that relationship, and completely hid it from my parents for 2 years. I then told them at some point after I was 18 that I had just started seeing him, and omitting a lot of information about the relationship. \line\line\line\line He was a pathological liar, and more manipulative than any human I had ever met, \strike which at first was like\strike0  \highlight1 At first this was like\highlight0  the most amazing love and the most incredible compatibility and the most gratifying relationship I ever thought was possible. But over the years, I realized I was trapped in denial. I was clinging to a romanticized invented version of who he projected himself to be, and trying to avoid seeing the truth, that I was being played and used, and that he enjoyed the power \strike and duping delight\strike0  he experienced in his relationship with me, and multiple other relationships.\line\line\line\b Rejecting Christianity and acquiring new beliefs\b0\line At age 19 I went from any sort of lukewarm feeling of Christianity to completely renouncing it, because I believed Christian beliefs were just weighing me down with the weight of unnecessary guilt and shame. And I reasoned that I had met plenty of great, happy people who did not know Jesus, who I reasoned did not need a savior. I thought Christianity was a narrow-minded way, and that I was seeking the bigger, better picture. So, I embraced beliefs that went along with my feelings that nobody needs a savior, since we are all truly good in our core.\line\line\line\line Any belief about love and kindness was good and any belief that brought any sense of guilt and condemnation was hateful and wrong, and therefore, should be thrown out the window. So here I was rejecting the true God and over time adding more and more beliefs to myself based on what felt good to my heart. It\rquote s interesting to note that my spiritual attacks at this point of denouncing Christianity became \strike seldom to never,\strike0  \highlight1 infrequent,\highlight0  and I also embraced the idea of spirit guides, that there were good spirits around me.\line\line\line\line Just before turning 20, my relationship ended, \strike based on evidence on the internet my sister had found of new partners this guy had had for at least the entire last year of our relationship, when he had been telling me about all these horrible things happening to him and reasons why he was hardly ever able to see me.\strike0  \highlight1 My sister found evidence on the internet that this guy had been seeing new partners for at least the entire last year of our relationship. For this whole time, he had been telling me about all these horrible things happening to him and reasons why he was hardly ever able to see me.\highlight0  My denial bubble had been popped, and it felt like my whole world got flipped upside down.\line\line\line\line I realized the painful truth more and more each day. I couldn\rquote t trust anybody. If this man was a wolf in sheep\rquote s clothing, and I had been drawn to him, how could I possibly trust myself to protect myself from the other psychopaths and pathological liars of the world? I became obsessed for a time over how to identify warning signs, how not to be an easy target. I got studied up on how to project confidence and dominance in both the social and business worlds, and practiced being as aware \strike and scrupulous\strike0  of other people\rquote s behavior as possible.\line\line\line\line I sought comfort in my spirituality, and kept adding to my picture, to make sense of good and evil. My compilation of beliefs included \strike what I now know the technical term for is\strike0  \ldblquote pantheism,\rdblquote  or belief that the universe is God, that we are all a piece of God, and that the whole purpose of life is for this God universe to experience itself and it\rquote s own vastness. \line\line\line\line I romanticized about this infinite Universe \highlight2 with infinite dimensions in which our imaginations create physical things in other dimensions and in which every decision we make splits us off into a different path in a different dimension to live out our life in that form,\highlight0  meaning we have infinite possibilities and from our present place in our Earthly bodies we can't quite see them yet.\line\line\line\line I believed in law of attraction which is essentially faith in the universe to give you something you want if you just call it to yourself. The power is within you, if you just believe. I believed in following signs based on intuition, and that this would lead me down the best path and draw success and happiness and abundance to my life. \line\line\line\line I believed in reincarnation \highlight2 that was not bound by earth or linear time; that each time we die we would be connected to the rest of the pieces that make up the God of the universe and know everything and then we go back maybe in an elevated life of connection to the source or maybe in a harder life with the goal to elevate other souls and their vibrations based on our own souls skill level and accumulated High vibration.\highlight0  In this way I could justify good and evil, light and darkness, joy and despair as necessary experiences, but never ever leading to Eternal separation or damnation. \strike This is a teaching I picked up in many places, but Wayne Dyer was an especially noteworthy, renowned spiritual teacher I remember hearing. \strike0\line\line\line\line All were one in this God universe. I thought this picture was so good, and correct. It explained terrible things in the world as just low vibration, something that the collective God was experiencing and all part of the plan, that it would eventually grow to reach a higher vibration, and not to worry. \line\line\line\line beliefs like this I would expand on and daydream about. Belief in the Law of Attraction would reward me, and success in my dream career was the main point of my life. I was called to be myself as much as possible in a way that influences other people. I was interested in things such as yoga, reiki, meditation, energy work, and other healing practices. I also had a concept of things such as ancient alien theory, spirit guides, and things of that nature. I was even told I was a \ldblquote star child,\rdblquote  an older, elevated extraterrestrial spirit who came back to Earth to raise the spiritual vibration of others. \line\line\line\line I definitely was glad to embrace these beliefs. I thought I was seeing the bigger picture than Christianity, and I believed that if a person was spiritually intentional at all, they would be connected with the true life force and be able to live out happy and fulfilled lives and that there would also be something beautiful awaiting them after life on Earth no matter what.\line\line\line\line So my experience of separateness from God had been one where I thought I had found fulfillment. I had a false sense of Salvation and spiritual contentment because I believed there were no serious \strike finite\strike0  consequences to the states of our minds and hearts here on Earth. I had confidence that I was doing good just by walking in my own ways. I had confidence I could die any moment, and I would be totally fine. I felt very bold and confident the more I was validated in this walk. I was in manic states of happiness 90% of the time. My head was always foggy and floaty; light as a feather. I was a workaholic because my job was following my passions and bringing people happiness and I had to give it everything I had; \line\line\line\line I was aware to a degree of the consequences, that I was caring more about the work than the personal relationships, that I felt general disconnect, that I felt that I was putting on a face and had to hide my faults, fears, sadness, and history; that nobody really knew me. At the same time I took comfort in the safety in nobody knowing me. I was in the power seat, and I kept my vulnerability to a minimum. I had confidence in myself to keep darkness from entering my life. I was compelled to embrace and project this always happy version of myself to encourage others to do the same, to raise everyone\rquote s spiritual vibration, and in the moments of darkness and trouble, I hid so nobody could see.\line\line\line\line\b Enters guy who challenges my beliefs\b0\line So then, I bumped into this guy online, Mike, who is now my significant other. We emailed for about a year before I finally agreed to meet him. He is a Christian, with a much darker background. That is another story all of its own. I had started talking to him because I felt he could answer questions I had about what evil is, spurned on by still dealing with the long relationship that had hurt me. \line\line\line\line He was very open and honest about the wrongs in himself, and of the fruits of his wrong behaviors. He also started planting seeds about God. I rejected them; they did not align with me. He was so patient with me, but also never fell back from what he had said. I felt love for him, but did not want to have anything to do with him; I was afraid to face my feelings and let my guard down to him, especially knowing how much he pushed the gospel, and how his life in Christ didn\rquote t align with my life that was all about worldly success and promotion of happiness and fun as the ultimate goal in life.I cut ties for 6 months, to see if my interest would wane. It did not, and he had waited for me. So, we started talking again, and seeing each other. He was witnessing to me, and I was incredibly against him telling me what he was telling me. He was insistent that he couldn\rquote t stand to see me angry or uncomfortable by what he said, but even more so, he had no choice but to tell me the truth, because of his love for me. Even if it meant I rejected him.\line\line\line\line He showed me materials that went over the origins of a lot of my beliefs, which a lot of them, I found out, fall under the new age beliefs, which is extremely prevalent among my generation. New age is a mix-up of a lot of different religions and sciences fusing together, and it\rquote s all connected in some way to \strike Satanism,\strike0  \highlight1 seeking Lucifer's knowledge and power,\highlight0  which branches out into many religions, in different forms that appeal to different kinds of people. I could not deny there was something to it, and that it did oddly connect dots pretty seamlessly. Mike prayed for me, and encouraged me to pray to God, and ask Him to show me if He is real.\line\line\line\line\b Facing Truth of God and Satan\b0\line Eventually I started praying, especially on my drives to and from work-- as non-committal as possible. At first, sarcastically and disrespectfully, feeling very silly about it, as if I was praying to a being that did not exist. Then my prayers gradually went from cynical to angry, and I recognized I had a lot of anger between God and I, if He was real. \line\line\line\line I began to recognize that He was real, but I did not trust Him. I doubted His goodness, and believed the opposing spiritual forces were the true good because they were the most appealing from my perspective. My heart was on their side. I was at enmity with God in my heart, but I could not deny Him. My prayers became sincerely angry and bitter. I wanted God to explain Himself to me. Why would He put His creation through all of this evil and darkness, just for much of it to fall to darkness? Why would He put me through all the painful things in my life and put me in a position where I hated Him? Surely He was not good, I thought. Just a big bully in the sky. But acknowledging His presence was the start of my coming back to Him.\line\line\line\line Each day as I prayed and researched and sorted out my thoughts. My other beliefs were breaking down. I felt very insecure and depressed. I didn\rquote t trust my former beliefs, and I didn\rquote t trust God. I stripped down my old beliefs and felt like I had stripped away a false shelter. I was uncomfortable and hopeless for months and months, because I had lost all false sense of salvation and purpose, and I was so stubborn not to trust God. I prayed for Him to help me genuinely have faith. I wanted it based on tangible facts though. I kept reading and researching, trying to find tangible facts that would get me to believe or disbelieve. I had so much pride in myself, that I was so good that I could judge God and \highlight1 judge\highlight0  whether or not He was also good.\line\line\line\line During this difficult time of questioning my beliefs, when I started to open my heart to Jesus and Yahweh God, I started to experience sleep paralysis and demonic type attacks again at night. Being a bit more mature and awakening to the truth of the situation, I identified that it was demons who were \strike upset that I was\strike0  \highlight1 trying to discourage me from\highlight0  questioning my beliefs \strike that kept me in their hands.\strike0  \line\line\line\line In some cases, I felt like I was being pinned down, in one case I felt that I was being dragged along my wall. I would also wake up from nightmares and feel the presence of something evil in my room. Even before my full conversion experience, I called on Jesus for help to stop the attacks, and they stopped as soon as I could speak His name. I was able to return to rest each time I called on Him, having confidence He would protect me in my sleep for the rest of the night.\line\line\line\line\b The power of testimony\b0\line I experienced the power of testimony when I started watching testimonies on youtube of people converting to Christianity. Muslim to Christ. Buddhist to Christ. Atheist to Christ. New Ager to Christ. Witch to Christ. Satanist to Christ. Jew to Christ. Gay man to Christ. Lesbian to Christ. They brought me tears. It was so real and in my face how God reaches hearts so powerfully, if only He is let in the gate. And then He works on them, saves and restores and strengthens and protects them.\line\line\line\line The testimonials were the final driving point. So many other people believed what I believed, and the lies were exposed in their submission to God. They knew my struggle. And I knew Jesus knew my struggle. I knew that my heavenly Father was so loving and patient, letting me blow off my ignorant steam this whole time, like an angry toddler.\line\line\line\line I surrendered to Jesus, and welcomed Him to enter my life and lead the way. I apologized to God for my pride, and for all the sin I had committed in my pride. I asked Jesus many times with sincerity to come into my heart, and change me, and change my life. I knew I needed Him. I was flooded with thankfulness to God. I knew I didn\rquote t deserve the patience shown to me. It was from a true loving and gracious God. The day I finally accepted Christ was March 15th of last year.\line\line\line\line\b After Accepting Christ\b0\line The day I accepted Him, I felt an incredible relief wash over me. I knew my authority in Christ, that no demon could do harm to me, or shake me, or hold me in terror, with Jesus as my protector. The legal rights were taken from them. They had no power in my life anymore.\line\line\line\line And then I lived happily ever after! Just kidding, it has been a serious struggle, with a lot more challenges and hardships, but I have Jesus helping me through how to walk in His way, and I know that He is using the trials to give me spiritual growth, and that it is worth it.\line\line\line\line When I accepted Christ, I died to the flesh in a big way. A lot of the things that had formerly given me a sense of identity and fulfillment didn\rquote t make sense to me anymore. It was scary and confusing, and is not a situation that makes sense to the world.\line\line\line\line I lost a lot of desires, and gained new desires in a very small amount of time. How was I supposed to explain that to the loved ones in my life, especially the ones that still had similar beliefs to what I had believed? I got rid of a lot of things that mattered to me before. They all just appeared to me as distractions from God. I experienced a lot of separation from former interests. Each day, I felt like letting go of more and more things and practices that I felt were not enriching my relationship with God and my growth in the Spirit with Him.\line\line\line\line I experienced a lot of loneliness among people, because what I was going through would not make sense to a lot of the people I knew. I wanted to hold on to what the Holy spirit was telling me, without offending people, without making people think that I had lost my mind or settled for a lesser belief than theirs. I wanted to forsake my old ways without forsaking people, and it felt like an impossible juggling act. And in a way, it is. I am not responsible for their understanding or reactions. But I can take it to God. He has the perfect plan.\line\line\line\line The ways God changed my heart are not the same as what He changes for every Christian. He is a personal God, and He works first in the places where we have our greatest weaknesses. God has changed me in ways that brought the power back to my relationship with Him. I deeply questioned all things that brought me a sense of pride in my goodness or my own understanding or my own power, as well as the goodness of the world and the power of the world.\line\line\line\line God touched my heart when it came to giving to people in need. I am not the judge of whether or not they deserve to be given to. Really none of us deserve any of what we get, it is all by grace and blessing. And God says \ldblquote you were given to freely, so freely give.\rdblquote  I had formerly become cold to homeless people or any person asking for money, because I thought they were all undeserving manipulative liars. But now I know it is my duty as a follower of Christ to share His love, whether it appears to be deserved or not. Just like Jesus dying on the cross and sacrificing everything for us though we do not deserve it. We are meant to freely give and pursue living with Him on our heart all the time. He gives through us.\line\line\line\line God also took away my desire to adorn myself with earrings and makeup, and to feel beautiful as he created me. I also had desire to dress more modestly. I also became sensitive to aspects of my artistic business and line of work that encourage worldliness or false spirituality, and started phasing out those things. These have become stepping stones in my journey.\line\line\line\line After just a couple weeks of coming to Christ, a close friend of mine died unexpectedly, and God carried me through it. I was kind of expecting Him to allow me to raise her from the dead. To my chagrin, He did not. But He placed so much of His blessing and goodness around us that it was undeniable that He was there, and that He was working through this situation.\line\line\line\line God also helped me to forgive the man whom I had been in a relationship with in my late teen years. After not seeing this person for 4 years, I saw him in passing twice within the same week, and it brought painful feelings up to the surface, mostly shame and anger. I felt that God set that up so I could recognize what was buried deep in my heart, so I could work through it and find forgiveness and healing.\line\line\line\line\b God\rquote s word Comes Alive\b0\line I have had my eyes opened to the power of scripture. Now that the Holy Spirit is guiding me, His word has become so alive; different points of scripture connect like neurons connecting brain cells, and represent truth distributed across layers of reality. So many of the parables and stories reveal the true nature of God, and the true nature of the world. It is mind-boggling. **incomplete**\line\line\line\line\b Up Ahead\b0\line Every day, I feel God\rquote s love, and every day is intense. I have to consciously cling to Him each day, and fight against my carnal nature and pride, and allow the Holy Spirit to lead the way. Each day, each success and each mistake, I am thankful He is using it all to strengthen my faith in Him. There is a lot of my house on the sand still to tear down, and a lot of my new home on the rock to build up. But God is patient and awesome, and I am listening as best as I can to Him. I look forward to getting closer to Him by His grace. Each day, it is my hope that my heart is changed more and more and filled with better desires and more of His wisdom. I intend to continue to pray, read His word, and seek Him as much as I possibly can each new day. Every day is a fight against lies of the world, and embracing the truth in God.\par
