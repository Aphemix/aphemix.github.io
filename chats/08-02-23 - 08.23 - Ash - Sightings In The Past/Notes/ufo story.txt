> I like your ufo story. You should tell me again. XD

> what, the story where I saw the thing in my backyard?

> Yes lol.

> okay, so, once upon a time,
> I was sitting at a computer in my family's house when I heard extremely peculiar noises coming from the direction of my backyard, which sounded something like R2D2 speaking, or perhaps a synthesized duck call, or a synthesized didgeridoo
> it was probably about 1 or 2 in the morning

> Mhmm

> there was a window immediately next to me facing my backyard, right next to my head, so I turned to my side and looked out the window, wondering what the noises were
> and I saw an unnatural formation of floating red lights arranged in a 3D geometric pattern, hovering above the grass in the yard
> I was immediately terrified and by reflex I ducked down out of sight from the window as if running from gunshots

> I really love this story btw lol.

> for perhaps the next 20 minutes I sat crouched out of sight in the next room, most of the time while continuing to hear the noises
> eventually the noises stopped and I decided I was going to go out there and figure out what the thing was, so I got up and went back in the direction of the backyard, but the lights were gone
> that's the story, but for probably years after that I always felt spooked out when I passed by my backyard in the dark, there was a deck that connected from the main house to my room which was separate, very near to where the lights appeared, and I walked out there a lot
