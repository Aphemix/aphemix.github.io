aphemix (5:11:02 PM): I probably told you before about the UFO thing I saw in my backyard some years ago right
secret slime (5:11:09 PM): i don't tink so
aphemix (5:11:15 PM): well
aphemix (5:11:20 PM): it was nuts
aphemix (5:12:20 PM): I heard some strange R2D2 type noises, I remember describing them as "synthesized duck calls," can't remember exactly what they sounded like, but really weird and abnormal sounding
aphemix (5:12:45 PM): heard them out the window right next to me while I was minding my own business on the computer so I looked out the window into my backyard
aphemix (5:13:41 PM): and I just see this formation of red lights, the formation looks like a shape, as though each light was a corner of a polygon or something, but I can see my backyard in between the lights, there was nothing solid there, it was just this pattern of lights floating by itself with these noises coming from it
aphemix (5:14:12 PM): so I immediately duck for cover out of view of the window like I'm being shot at or something, totally terrified
aphemix (5:14:26 PM): and I hide out of view for a while hearing these noises persist
aphemix (5:14:49 PM): then they stop for some time, and I finally summon the balls to go look out the window again and see what it was, but the lights were gone
aphemix (5:14:55 PM): and that's it
secret slime (5:16:26 PM): damn dude
aphemix (5:16:28 PM): I was probably like 18 when this happened, doubt I was on any drugs, maybe high on weed or something, and by myself
secret slime (5:16:37 PM): that sounds like a classic ufo sighting
secret slime (5:17:22 PM): thats crazy tho
aphemix (5:17:39 PM): ya surprised I never mentioned it, I've brought that up to a lot of people any time anything similar comes up
aphemix (5:19:37 PM): the shape was scary, too, it was like a 3D rhombus shape or something, two stories, like two rhombus shaped panels stacked on top of each other, but each corner was a little red light and the rest was transparent
secret slime (5:21:59 PM): thats heavy
secret slime (5:22:02 PM): i can picture that shit too
aphemix (5:22:04 PM): lol
secret slime (5:22:14 PM): clearly not of human origin
aphemix (5:22:30 PM): it was right here in this house's backyard and I still get creeped out to this day when I look at that spot and it's dark out
