7 am. Going into the office, as Jennifer had comp day on thursday. Reaching for socks or something I knock over _______'s weird little Pope bobblehead she purchased maybe 3 or 6 months back and the head pops cleanly off. I let her know and then put it on her desk, to be fixed later.

7 pm. I take a THC gummy and start batch painting kroot kinstalkers (40k miniatures). Please note I took adderal late today and I'm still feeling it's effects, so the work goes quickly and I'm making "great progress".

10 pm. aphemix contacts me via text. He's a long term religious contact back from when I was really intensely into religion/Christianity and having lots of conflicts with others (family mostly, but some close friends) over it. He links a git.hub. filled with screencaptures of texts and his like diary entries I guess. It also has 2 images of a notebook with drawings. the 2 images trigger insanely bad anxiety. "bad trip" I think at the time. The first is mostly rephrasing ideas about broad way (to hell) / narrow way (to heaven) and the second is comparing a Sinful vs Godly man. both freak me out but the latter feels insanely "targeted" at me which maybe just says more about me? But its freaky and weird. At some point I'll go back to this document and try to match lines to relevant bible verses but OTOH it's mostly drawn from the parables of Jesus in the gospels with some additional stuff from revelation in there.

see: Aphemix.Github.io

Distrubingly, are named "portrait draft" 1 and 2. Are they supposed to be portraits of me?

some key phrases from them 
..."working real hard for that which perishes"
"christ crucified anew"
"thorns" (i.e. worldly concerns that keep you from god, iirc it had stuff like worrying about your job or that kind of thing)
"every tongue nation tribe" (but on the wide path, i.e. to hell)
(as characteristic of a sinful man; i.e. he worries about) "lots of food to eat / having a job / being a dude / his hobbies" as well as "there are no sons of God"/"There are no miracles"/"Trusting in his own studies"
"a lifeless idol/god of/in his own image"

other misc.

Please also note Aphemix was initially texting me to indicate 1. he is now homeless, again (he was homeless when we first started talking circa 2010~2011) and appearantly on the basis of a claim of abuse from his wife and wife's father, who he had previously reported having conflicts of a religiously charged nature with. My last text from him indicates he is sleeping on cardboard. Our inteaction starts with me being somewhat flabbergasted by this and critisizing it. 
 
my dog started throwing up/eating own vomit while talking to aphemix while I was trying to criticize or at least suggest being homeless like this is in fact, a bad thing (and I immediately worry its some sort of divine omen indicating my concern or criticism is unwarranted or bad or sinful or whatever, as there is a bibical proverb using this image).

aside: this feels metaphircally like a "man in the middle attack" (kind of ceullar hacking attack) / aphemix had previously noted a spirit of fear. Although I keep trying to dismiss or get away from these thoughts I can't help but admit they are in keeping with some conservative interpreations of new testment verses (or in many cases, very close to or nearly verbatim to them). 

I write a note on my phone to 1. no longer use THC 2. start reading the bible with _______ 3. de-emphasize concerns about my physical appearance.

11:30 am. reach out to Pat. He offers support. I watch him and the discord crew stream starcraft for a while. fall alseep at some time after 1 am.

17/15/2023, Saturday

1am-6am. sleep is poor. feel like I'm freezing to death.

8 am ~ 11 am. follow up texts with Pat. He replies and we have longer exchange at 10:45 pm where he suggests we block aphemix. "this dude is like a special hammer that just hits on a big fear you have." / "He's a guy you know who sings a song that you fear. block him and be done with it." / "____, if talking to this guy blows up your entire sense of well being then you need to stop talking to him."

10 am. Me, _______, Kiara, are hiking. I burst into tears. Tell her I love her. We start back to the car. I explain (echoing the conversation with pat) a general fear of dismissing this guy in the event he is some sort of legitimate christian mystic or prophet or similar, and my fear of blocking him, so she offers to do so. I give her my phone and she does. I suggest maybe I should go to my parent's house. We ultimately don't.

12 pm: prepping for 2k warhammer game with JC. Nothing bad is happening in my headspace, really. 

1pm: Start said game. I get first turn. I am flying through my deployment and movement. the FLGS 40k group chat is surprised at photos of the board state.

3pm: anxiety begins to creep in during game. "his hobbies" from git.hub image is creeping back in. I feel guilty for even being here playing the game. I can't stop thinking about hell. 

3:45 pm: game is over, I've resigned and am packing up, I sit and talk with JC as I'm trapped in the store by a thunderstorm while we wait for Frank to show up and play a second game with JC. He offers support, he's a good guy. I start to feel better. Too much nervous laughter.

7 pm?: I take 20 mg of CBD oil and together with sleeping tea + lemon tea fall into a stupor and fall alsleep. My chest still hurts. At one point get called by my dad, we have a conversation about his own anxieties. 

17/16/2023 Sunday.

9 am ~ 10:30 am. _______, Me, and Kiara walk to winters park and back home. It is oppressively humid and hot and lightly raining. the dog lies on the cool tile floor when we get home and I wipe her with a wet paper towel to ensure she isn't overheating. While we are out there anxiety returns again, centering on a very strange christian memoir from years ago where a woman, respectively, reported a vision of a book that told her future (but that she could not recall the details of), as well as having to leave her christian but ultimately skeptical husband (she reports some sort of miraculous rescue from a car wreck where the car's momentum suddenly vanishes right after her husband expresses disbelief in the ability/willingess of God to do miracles), taking her 2 children to a poorly developed part of south america to be a missionary. I keep thinking "I really don't want my wife to leave me / for me to leave her." Pretty obviously also thinking about the thorns line from Aphemix's notebook images.

afternoon: Dog needs a bath, and so do I. My thoughts on the doctrine of hell start to turn into actual anger at the unjustness of it from my human perspective. I'm listening to twitch streamer PeachSaliva go on about some weird roommate she had in college. I've had CDB oil again but it's not really relaxing me bc I also had to have 2 anti-migraine pills at this point.

Evening: I start crying again and conclude these anxieties can't be of God as they're having the effect of making me resent God and start underlining verses in a pocket sized new testament for comfort. I express these feelings to Pat in a discord message and basically feel relatively normal the rest of the evening, and thank God for feeling normal for once in the weekend. SF6 top 8 is a series of good sets, with a strong Lily man who finishes 4th. Sf commentator Yipes is appearantly a christian, so that's nice.

7/17/2023, Monday

11 am. first mental attack. In the office. centered on soiteroloigy. specifically, whether I am really a christian. Lots of thoughts on the "I never knew you" condemnation of the damned in Matthew 7. I start writing this document, planning to share with a counseler or therapist at a future date. It takes roughly an hour to write out this entire document.

(I was weighing whether or not to take my medication out of concern that it might make things bad but I ultimately kind of have no choice but to as right away Jennifer is calling me up with ad hoc invoice transfer requests that demand a lot of high-detail precision.)
