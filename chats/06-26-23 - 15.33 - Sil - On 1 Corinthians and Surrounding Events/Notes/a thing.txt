the claim, the sense, says that on one hand, Paul is writing literally, to a literal Corinthian church about literal situations present to him at the time of his writing, yet on the other hand, that there is also a parallel layer of meaning, running throughout the majority of the entire letter, through which the Holy Spirit is speaking spiritually, using various modes of presentation and various illustrative devices, testifying very consistently to two things, two things which in fact agree.

each of these two things, the two things to which the Holy Spirit is supposed to be testifying, is a complex thing, requiring many clarifications in order to be rightly received according to how I intend it to be received when I describe it. Therefore I will seek to illustrate in depth what each of these two things are, and how I myself consider them, in the hope that I myself am rightly communicated and understood while I attempt to tell the truth about these two things.

the first thing the testimony is supposed to agree to is this. It is the perspective and the insight that I -- Rebekah's husband, a man -- have continually recognized as a perspective converging upon the truth, an insight into the actual truth, regarding the true nature of the situation between myself and my wife, a situation which has continued according to the same pattern for many years. This thing is mine; it pertains directly to my own observations and experiences; it pertains directly to my own models of understanding -- models which propose explanations for the phenomena which are received directly through these, my own observations and my own direct experiences of my marriage.

these things are familiar to me, and I can testify to them from my own experiences. I can testify that my models seem diligent and well-tested; that with all thoroughness, they do not seek to consider data inappropriately; that they seem to regard data very much according to how the truth itself indicates the data should be regarded, rather than according to some other thing -- for example, according to how my own preference says I should regard them, according to how false beliefs indicate I should regard them, and such things like these. I can testify to this -- the origin of my explanatory models, the personal consistency of my own experiences -- from my own memory and my own present understanding, because these, my memory and my understanding of my own experiences, seem completely available to me, and seem that they will not lie. I recognize this testimony to be dependent on the reliability of my memory and the accuracy of my own knowledge of my own experiences, but I feel these things have demonstrated themselves to be sufficiently reliable on a consistent basis, so I at least trust them. I also expect that this testimony to my own experience is completely consistent with Rebekah's experiences, particularly her repeated memories, and perhaps even her understanding, of my own previous testimonies, which have occurred in conversations with her on a regular basis for many years. I must stress: I cannot, however, testify to the complete truth content indicated by my models, or the true accuracy of the models. I believe I have tried to conform them to the truth about as hard as I can, but I cannot testify their attempts at the truth have actually produced truth. This is because I cannot verify the true accuracy of my memory or my knowledge, including the true accuracy of the claims which say the explanatory models have rightly handled the truth as I believe they have. Such a strong testimony as this is unavailable to me, because I cannot authenticate that the pure truth, the real truth, is the same truth indicated by my experiences.

in summary, I would call this the testimony of my own heart. It is the best attempt at the truth I find available to myself. It seeks to submit to God in every known way. I find that God has also made me very capable in these things, himself being completely responsible for any good I am able to do with my heart, but I insist that my heart is still my own heart. I therefore testify freely to it, but my testimony is conditional. It includes the caveat that the heart I am speaking from is truly my own heart, and that what I mean, when I testify, is that it should be taken precisely as my own heart testifying -- not as any higher authority than mine alone.

the second thing to which the Holy Spirit is supposed to be testifying, which is supposed to agree to the first as well, is this. It is the true heart and the true word of the true God, speaking again to the precise situation of my own marriage and the forces involved. I, of course, cannot testify now that the intention I would assume of God's word is truly the intention of his word, because I am a man, and only God can testify to the truth of himself. But I can testify from my memory and my own knowledge and say that previously, my own experience of these things was consistent. It authenticated itself all by itself, to my eyes. To elaborate: I have a present approach to the truth which seeks to be cautious, which seeks to deemphasize and negate all deceiving factors, which seeks to be honest and clear, which seeks to only testify truly and to avoid false testimony, and according to my own knowledge of my experiences, and my own memory, this present approach to the truth I now employ is a far inferior approach to another, second approach which has, at times, previously shown itself as available to me. I cannot now account for the absolute truth content that has been indicated by this second approach, and so therefore, I cannot presently testify that this second approach has indeed produced actual truth. I am a man. It is unknowable to me. Yet I can testify from my memory, and from my own experiences, that these things were experienced as having authenticated themselves fully, in every way now imaginable to me and more, at previous times, when this second approach had shown itself as being the approach that was then being employed. I will also testify now, from my own memory and my own experiences now, that in previous times when I testified very weighty things of which I am now afraid, the reason, explaining why I would count myself qualified to testify to these weightier things, is because I experienced, at those times, that this testimony was justified, and was appropriate, according to this second approach to the truth, which, during those times, I experienced that I was then employing as my own approach.

these things are complex, as I've said, and so I must clarify further about what position I now find myself to be in, according to how I presently understand it. I say this, that I am in a position now where I only trust myself to testify truly to my own heart and my own experiences. I do not trust myself or consider myself qualified to testify to the truth of God. But I recognize myself to have previously been subject to a different condition where these elements had likewise taken different forms. I see in my own memory that this previous condition was absolutely whole; truly consistent in every way I can now imagine. I see in my own memory that in this previous condition, my heart was completely unified with a truth that was recognized at that time as being higher than my own heart. Experientially, everything false was known to be false, everything unknown was known to be unknown, and just the same, everything that was true, or supposedly true, was known to be true in this condition. I could not testify the false in prayer in this condition. I instead testified in prayer only according to the thing which showed itself to be true, with absolute confidence, with no shame of any kind, and with no apparent insincerity or unknown motive at any time.

I see in my memory that this previous condition is characterized by a state of continuous awareness. No thought went unchecked in this condition, according to my memory. No thought and no motivation came to me invisibly, and so too did no thought and no motivation escape my sight without simultaneously being judged and categorized according to the highest sense of truth available to me at that time -- a sense which I would describe, based on my own memory, as truly alive; truly new continually; continually revised; continually pruned, and so on. I see in my memory that I myself performed this judging and categorization process, in every single known instance, to every single known thought. I know I described this process in exactly these terms many times as it was ongoing, and I cited examples that were current many times, during many instances when I spoke of them as they were happening. This judgment process was understood to be my responsibility, and why wouldn't it be? It was understood to be a responsible and right stewardship over my mind, which otherwise, would be recklessly loose, and would not be conformed to the truth. And by what means was it right? I speak again from memory: it was right on the basis that it considered the highest conception of living truth available to me in real time, every single time, and deferred to it, every single time. It wanted absolutely nothing else. It wanted to just look at God and serve him, and thank him, and praise him, and love him, and nothing else at all. This is what my memory knows, and my memory knows I also testified in exactly this way all throughout the entire time these things were current to me.

I cannot now appoint myself a judge of what the Holy Spirit is truly speaking. Instead I must rely on the observations and the approaches of my present heart, with my present mind, and use these tools to produce an approximation of what the Holy Spirit perhaps would've been speaking, if indeed the Holy Spirit had even been speaking in the first place. In truth, I do not even want to look at 1 Corinthians. I read the book maybe six times yesterday. It was experienced clearly, the entire time, as the most extraordinary thing I had ever, ever seen. But now it is just a memory, and so too are half of my previous tools just a memory of the tools and how they worked. I am hurt. I recoil from Scripture and from prayer. Not as though they are bad, as though God is not God, do I recoil, but as though it is vital, as though the stakes are truly my life, that I must apply a greater skepticism and a greater restraint than I have ever known, in order that I will not wrongfully land in some place that, to my present mind, appears terrifying, appears dangerous, appears likely enough to be wrong, that it comes to be experienced as my having no choice but to recoil and to do less. There is a sense in which I feel I am truly lost, and that the lost I am is perhaps the most lost that could even be possible. It hurts me very much. I don't even know if it makes me weaker, and neither is it observable to me in the fruit of my behavior, but it seems likely to me that my present state, and its difficulty, truly does make me weaker as well. But I don't know.

at the same time, patched together with memories, and with present understanding from my own experience which seems to indicate a reasonable picture of the truth, I still have a sense that remains. I am terrified of it, and I am terrified even more to be in agreement to it, but in some capacity, it still remains. It is accompanied by a continuous song of triumphant gladness that echoes in my heart, in my thought, and sometimes in my mouth, but that is now much quieter than before, and which I now recoil from, rather than willing myself to perpetuate it or legitimize that it is there -- save in this very text I now write, of course, where I now seek to be as truthful as I can.

the sense that remains tells me with conviction that I am receding in the wrong direction. The sense that remains is what brings to my rememberance all the things I now describe as memory, and also brings to my awareness all the things I now refuse to claim are truths, testifying to itself that these things are precisely the things that demonstrate and authenticate that the memories themselves are reinforcements, or anchors, which ensure that the picture of truth I now describe from far away is, indeed, an accurate picture of accurate truth that remains completely authenticated and completely whole, to which I should instead draw nearer still.

I recoil so much! And in response to my recoil, my sense shows me a picture, which simultaneously as it is experienced, testifies to itself that it is prophetic, and this picture illustrates that I am exactly the same as all those to whom I have testified from my mouth, who have heard me and been terrified, who have run to contrary explanations immediately -- indeed, no matter whether a diligent scrutiny has justified them, having no interest in diligence at all, but rather, in pure resistance and fear, just so they themselves may avoid receiving what they would otherwise be required to receive had they done anything else but run. This itself, this picture of how my behavior has been received, is yet another model of the truth -- one which the sense in me is fully willing to claim as true, but that I myself am too scared, and presumably too unqualified, to testify of my own will. I have my own pictures that line up very closely to the things asserted freely by the sense, but again, my own experience is mine. I do not claim that mine is true, because I cannot, and therefore I must not. But the sense just says it.

the sense, again, and in such a way that is inseparable from a testimony to its own authority, shows me clearly that I am affected by my experiences. It shows me that I am weak, too weak to sift my experiences continually and judge them, and am instead suffering the repercussions of their now being loosed and unchecked. It says that the effects are clear, and they are these: my earthly, bodily, human experiences in reality are being received as though they indicate more real truth than they actually do. They are being received through a lens of hurt and fear. They are being received as if the things in my immediate life and my immediate behavior, the scary outcomes in my life, the scary outcomes in my house, had more authority to testify than they actually truly have. The sense says that, in reality, these things are unknown, and the true outcome of them is unknown. The issues which currently seem difficult, and currently even seem wrong, have not shown themselves to truly indicate reality merely by the ways human beings have seen them and responded to them, including me myself, and also including my house. The sense even stirs me into a fervor as I consider these things. It takes a tone, in some inexplicable way that does not audibly speak, and the tone is one of seemingly righteous indignation, indeed, fury, that these things are truly clear, and that I know them already, and that I know that I know them, and that God himself has testified to them, again and again he has testified, says the absolute conviction of the sense I now suppress. The fervor in my heart, in my spirit, is such that these clear testimonies threaten even to loose themselves from my mouth of their own will and command themselves, and the direction they mean to speak to, to scream to, is exactly the direction to which I would pray. I say I am lost. The sense says in every way, LET MY PEOPLE GO!!! My truth, my proof, it cries. Release them, it cries. Pick up your cross, it says without speaking, only by some inexplicable, clearly authoritative tone, like I already know everything. I'm tryinggg, I plead. I'm trying SO HARD to do it! Help me, Lord, I am perishing, I plead. And all throughout my typing and my considering, and even my praying, if I can bear it, I cry so heavily, with so much more sorrow than I have ever cried.

I will get to the point. I do not want to look at 1 Corinthians at all. I do not even want to testify to what I want, or to assume that I should know any more than I know anything else. I do not even want to type what I've typed, because who am I to leash it to this mundane thing my hurt and my fear have made. I do not know that I have the strength to look over 1 Corinthians at any length. But I will try to present something palatable about chapter 5 according to the resources I find are available to me now. I know my memory well enough. I know how I have modeled and evaluated the situation of my marriage and my house for all the time I have seen it in my own experiences. I will therefore go little by little through the chapter, as it seems feasible to me. I will testify to how the picture I am seeing affirms the picture I have built from my own experience, saying nothing at all of the correctness of my own experience. I will then testify again to the best picture I now have, drawing from the memory and the knowledge I know, and perhaps drawing from unanticipated places, depicting how the Holy Spirit appeared himself to be testifying in the previous cases, cases where I recognized that the Spirit himself had affirmed my own picture as well. Take it however it will be taken; I do not know what will happen; it is not for me to say what will happen except that I will do what I will do now.

---------------------------------------------

1 COR 5:1

my heart says that my marriage and my wife from the beginning have been in a state of horrible, horrible bondage. I have sought to oversee, under God, to allow the doors of truth to be opened, that light itself might reveal the truth of the bondage, that my wife and my marriage might finally be free. I have sought to do this primarily through the avenue of Jesus Christ and the foundation of the gospel, but as a man, I have also all the while sought to do so through any insight and any strength that shows itself to be appropriate to me, again, under God. I have done this in various degrees of failure and weakness, but I am also highly confident that all the ways I have done it have sought the good, and have been well informed, and have been right in truth, considering of course that I am simply a man who is trying.

the bondage I recognize is this: my wife is contrary to truth and averse to truth in nearly every way, and primarily by this mechanism, she is also hurt and inviting further hurt in nearly every way. Anything that is not immediately received purely and by her immediate senses, she fears. She expects that all things will be clear to her at all times, and by every case where any thing is not clear, she is threatened. Therefore, the things she accepts, the things she gravitates to by nature, are guaranteed to be immediate, impulsive, easy, according to weakness, unverified, unknown, capitalized on by deceitful men, capitalized on by opportunistic sin, never able to be blamed, never able to be seen, never justifying anything but themselves, not least of all recognition, nor repentance of any kind. Therefore, the fear itself is unchecked, it speaks for itself, it confirms to itself that it signifies wrong, perpetuating itself, controlling its own will. I know in all my heart and all my knowledge that all these things are absolutely contrary to the walk of Christ, to the call of the gospel, to the life that is in God alone, in every way I have ever known, I am unified in this completely. To me, these things are truly the epitome of bondage, exceedingly worse even than being property owned by men.

for this reason, I must act. But the bondage is very entrenched, and a number of strongholds support it. One stronghold is the self reinforcing nature of the fear. Another stronghold is that, no matter how loving and no matter how diligent the husband, for example, who seeks to make it known, any contrary view will, generally speaking, in just the same way, reinforce that it is a purely inappropriate view, no matter the data, because it does not conform to the ease and the immediate evidence that she instead receives as testimony of the good, indeed, even to the exclusion of the data. But the primary stronghold to me, from the very beginning, has always been the unwarranted expectations and the unjustified imposition that is thrust upon my wife as she attempts to coexist among other people, who, for reasons of their own agendas or their own weaknesses, will act in such ways as to reinforce that all worldly things are good, and all common expectations of men are good, pressuring my wife; effectively guaranteeing that she will be beat into submission by the difficulty of her disagreements, however small; effectively guaranteeing that she will retreat again to the easy and the false. And from among these harmful social forces acting on my wife, from the very beginning, the primary toxic influence, reinforcing that she remain in the error of her ways, has always, always been her father.

John is a cool guy. I have no business holding any man to any standard. In earthly terms, he is agreeable, he is enjoyable. He has done me much kindness, and I am thankful to him. He has done Rebekah much service, and for this also, I am thankful. But I recognize with all my heart that his spirit is absolutely dead, and furthermore, that he wants it to be dead, and furthermore, that he does not hesistate to take all liberty in himself to do everything he wishes, contrary to Scripture, contrary to conscience, contrary to the harm to his own body, to ensure that his spirit is dead, simultaneously assuming righteousness and right conscience to himself on the basis of his medication-assisted good moods, on the basis of whatever existing allegiance he already has to his God, on the basis of his assumption that people are good, on the basis of his assumption that his life and his work and the approval of men indicate a true righteousness, and on other bases such as these. I cannot lie, these things are obvious to me, they are visible, and my spirit cries out against them. I do not count them as my things to judge against another, but my spirit cries out against them in complete unity, and there is no discrepancy.

but there is more. John also considers himself entitled to the heart of my wife and entitled to the life of my wife. He considers himself entitled on the basis of his fatherhood, on the basis of his right life he already has confirmed to himself, on the basis of his ignorance, and of other such things, which I do not consider myself to fully know. Yet I do know that he considers himself entitled, for it is obvious. He appoints himself the judge of me. He appoints himself the judge of which things are harmful and which things are permissible to my wife. He has judged me unworthy, and he appoints himself the savior of my wife, because I do not have the worthless things he insists are good for my wife, and he himself seeks them and loves them. In his capacity as self-appointed savior, he subjects my wife to himself, feeding her only the things which in reality deaden her spirit, the things he loves, which he says to himself that her worthy husband also would've done, if indeed there was any worthy husband. He is also the policeman of my wife. He exercises this power deceitfully, in the guise of light. He shows himself as kindness. Any time she expresses an approval of her husband deemed illegal by his law, he comes in the guise of hurt and worry, so that my wife will be seduced into obedience by her own conscience and her own love toward her father. If this ever fails, rare as it is, he shows himself as disapproval and anger, so that my wife will be seduced again into obedience by her own respect and her own love for her father. I will not curse this man. But my spirit cries out in absolute fury every single day, LET MY PEOPLE GO! I am so furious at this entire bondage, and I know this dead spirit is the center of it. But because of my wife's weakness, and because of her lack of understanding, and, indeed, even partially due to my own inability to seduce my wife in the like manner of her father, with every earthly thing, I have found myself bound to this worthless spirit in as much as John's influence over my wife exists in any capacity at all. I know what my enemy is. I hate my enemy and I desperately want to destroy my enemy so my wife, and even myself, can finally be free. So says my heart about 1 COR 5:1.

but apart from my heart, something else says, as a testimony to Rebekah: there is immorality among you, factually. A man has his father's wife, factually. You belong to your Father who is in Heaven. He owns you. You are his. He has blessed your marriage. He has appointed your husband to you by your own covenant, and even with accompanying signs. What God has joined together, let no man separate. Yet someone among you has appointed for himself the wife that in reality belongs to his Father, contrary to the good, contrary to the truth he has done it. So is the testimony apart from my heart about 1 COR 5:1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1 COR 5:2

my heart says that Rebekah should listen to her husband and accept the correction of her husband. He expects that he should be loving and not forceful, but he knows a shift in perspective is necessary, and he knows it is his own job to manage, under God, of course, but as a man. Because it is his job, it is actually truly right that this perspective shift is good, even in lieu of the failures of her human husband. Therefore Rebekah truly should shift her perspective in the interest of removing this problem her husband agrees is a problem, and it is truly wrong mindedness in her that disagrees. So says my heart about 1 COR 5:2.

apart from my heart, something else says, as a testimony to Rebekah: it is factually true that you should be in mourning. It is factually true that your failure to do this is arrogance, appointing yourself a judge you factually must not be. All these things are factually the things that must be done, because they lead to the further thing which also factually must be done: the removal of your dad who has done an evil that is factually evil and factually grave. So is the testimony apart from my heart about 1 COR 5:2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 COR 5:3-5

my heart recoils. My heart fully agrees, and cries out in triumphant song, but knows he is not the judge. So is all my heart can bear about 1 COR 5:3-5.

apart from my heart, something else says, as a testimony to Rebekah: LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU, THAT I WILL NOT BE ROUSED TO ANGER. I love you. More than you can know, I love you. Though I am not present in body, I testify that I am present in spirit in your house, and that it is factually I who have judged my judgment, equally in every way as though I were present with you. You have assembled together, only in Christ, who I have appointed as Lord to you, who my spirit accompanies. You have assembled together, under your husband, who I have appointed as lord to you as well, who my spirit also accompanies. In that assembly, in the power of that very spirit, it is factually I who have judged my judgment, that the evildoer would be removed from you, and indeed handed over to Satan for a time, for it is necessary, for I love John more than you know, and I must judge him now, that he will be saved in the day that is near.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't speak to this any more. I don't want to look at 1 Corinthians any more. Let somebody else play guessing games if that's what you're into. I am hurt. This is all I am ready to provide at the present time, because I feel irresponsible that I have even done what I have done. I write it to you now as clearly as I can, just in hopes that my intention is correctly understood, and able to be referenced later, in times when it seems good to evaluate it. I can speak on these things at length if I must, but I must be careful, and in fact I must be so careful that it is intimate and very weak for me, and so I am not very comfortable doing this to any significant extent except privately to my wife, and also to God.

may this reach whoever it reaches. Whoever it reaches, I approve.
