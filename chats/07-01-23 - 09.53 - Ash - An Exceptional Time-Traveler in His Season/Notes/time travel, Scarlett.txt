inexplicable prophecy decoder key:

Scarlett is Rebekah.
the relationship is the exact same relationship.
the ex-wife Nicky (ex street wife, that is) is Galina.
the same dude latched onto is the same adultery with the same rebellious spirit.
the smoking k2 together is their both drinking from the same cup: the PFAs, or some more general equivalent.
the foiling the attempted robbery is a direct reference to my low-key threat preventing my computers from being siezed.

Scarlett has been giving me a lot of trouble lately.

our relationship is a weird one, you see. Ever since first resolving in my mind that I am not interested in her as a mate, her appearance in my life hasn't messed with me or been an issue for me, and I've been hanging out with her fairly often. I mean, I already see her around all the time, and we are even something like friends. She needs a friend. But she is giving me a lot of trouble.

she remains attracted to me. More than that, though, she is also rather invested in the prospect of my being attracted to her: she believes that, if I act how she would have me act toward her, it will mean something, and it will correctly address her problems. Meanwhile, I am very direct toward her. I make a point to approach her in as platonic a manner as possible, and I will not jump through her hoops, but I do try, simultaneously, to address what she needs addressed, more reasonably, through the avenue of our friendship. It's something of a tricky situation, and she cries for my compliance constantly, desperate to conform my behavior to her own preferences. Because she is so difficult, I am continually struggling merely to interact with her in a way I am able to determine appropriate at all.

she behaves disruptively and obnoxiously. She intentionally presents herself to me as disagreeable, intending to measure, by my degree of persistence, whether my concern for her is genuine. She expects that, should I care about her, I will act like a codependent mate, who, like herself, is of unrealistic emotional investment, and will easily be disturbed from his place by insignificant minutiae. Long story short: she has determined, by her beliefs, that she will not drop her guard and be apprehended except in the case that one treats her horribly. Should we disagree, it is because I am an enemy. My interactions with her, as such, have been little more than my keeping my cool amid a steady barrage of destructive and childish behaviors, acting kindly despite her repeated attempts to elicit my worrying over her invented and fictitious problems. Oh, were she but a dog, this would be simple. 

lately, and much to my amusement, Scarlett has latched herself onto the same exact dude my ex-wife Nicky, in her own attempts to play head games with me, latched onto, herself. She is clearly doing this intending, specifically, to get a reaction out of me. I can tell by how incredibly outraged she is that I will not respond how she would like. Truth is, I am pleased that she has conjoined herself to someone more suited to her level of psychological development than I am. I mean, I don't want her to be treated badly, don't get me wrong, but she definitely does need to learn something, and she will, so, on this basis, I am pleased. And since, rather than being disrupted, I am pleased, Scarlett is outraged. But all of these things will work for good as her futile behavior is more comprehensively exhausted.

just last night, I was hanging out with her, as we sometimes do. Scarlett, apparently, in her attempts to engineer my worry and change my approach, was not satisfied with her merely advertising herself and making herself vulnerable to the sketchy dudes in her company, and decided to take her campaign a step further, ending up smoking k2 with them, also. For the next hour or so, I ended up babysitting rather intensively -- in consideration of what I understood of both the altered state of her head and the danger of her environment, I babysat.

as time passed, I noticed two of the people among us chatting secretly to one another, and I realized they were plotting to rob me for my laptop. Speaking in code about how they would go about doing it, right in my face. I mean, I speak in code, myself. It cost me very little effort to act subtly different, make it less convenient for them to stage the robbery, and prevent the attack, completely invisibly, without even revealing that I had known what was happening. Fuckin' chumps. Even still, though, Scarlett is giving me a lot of trouble. I need to work this nonsense out. I am not dealing with much more of this.

I'm late for my lunch, so I'm gonna go head to my lunch. My day is fairly good. Hope yours is also good. See you.
