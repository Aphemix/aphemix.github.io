  <p>
    thank you for looking at my things, whoever you are, whenever you are.
  </p>
  <p>
    truth is, I blabbed this thing and I don't even know what to do with it. I did not receive a command to blab it. Instead, I have seen so many instances, again and again in these past days, and completely absent my own knowing involvement besides, where the Lord has directed my steps, spoken his own things in my speech, and even prophesied accurately by my own unwitting writing from previous times in ways unthinkable to me, that I am inclined to just blab freely, as a person, having a spirit of sincere expectation that the Lord will just be in it by his own will, and will himself hold it up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have mixed feelings about having blabbed this. On one hand, if I am <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4">one who speaks,</a> I consider myself bound as to speak the oracles of God. Likewise, if I am <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4">one who knows the good I ought to do,</a> I consider myself bound that I do it and not sin. But I know I have seen many mentions of prophets having spoken presumptuously -- likely even alongside Old Testament instructions that they be stoned, though my memory now is vague. I know I have certainly spoken presumptuously to some extent, and to what extent, how could I even presume? So my feelings on my blabbing are somewhat mixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I considered these things. I considered taking down the image. I recognized quickly there is no need that I would do this. I recognize my doing this would accomplish no more than shielding me from being judged against by another person. I recognize this is contrary to the good, and even to my wants. If I am to be demonstrated to be in error, I agree in myself that the God who answers with fire is the one who should determine these things. As much as it is possible, I even welcome it as food, and I hope to welcome it as food. Therefore, I will not take down the image.
  </p>
  <p>
    know this: I do not testify the Lord has commanded what I speak. I will not assert my things as prophecy to you, dear reader, as if to testify that you yourself should believe them. I, myself, have no understanding in particular by which these, my own words, are demonstrated as truth to me -- for how could I have sufficient understanding to judge the true outcome of things? Though on a personal note, I will not lie: I do expect they are prophecy. I expect this on the basis that the Lord is truly doing whatever he wants with me, and I can do nothing. I expect it on the basis that I have blabbed plenty before, and I am a witness that the Lord himself will hold it up.

    though who am I kidding, really. I am typing to an imaginary audience. What's the difference.
