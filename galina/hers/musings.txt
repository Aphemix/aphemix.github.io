fucking myself.

tossing away the hand I should've played.
or was it?

will I ever know? only if I go...

is that worth my peace of mind?

this happened for a reason.

so I may come to a decision.

cannot deny my ambivalence at this point.

but what do I really want? I've been out of touch with that for a while now....
