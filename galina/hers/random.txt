Soul is always yearning to find it's way home as Odessyus on his mythical journey.

Do not miss the present. Soul is best expressed in the present.

Anxiety is nothing but fear inspired by an imagined future collapse. It is the failure of trust.



I can longer run and hide
pretending like I don't exist
there's meaning in these maladies
which refuses to be dismissed


you've been to war with yourself
but youre tired and you want to go home
your mind is aching and your bones
grown


senseless percieved chaos, mistakes that haunt.. it's hard to realize this is what makes you grow

what doesnt kill you
makes you stronger


I just sit going in mental circles 
inviting the music to touch my soul

this is just one of those days 
I lock myself in my room
friends lovers family
temporary reclusive misanthopy
