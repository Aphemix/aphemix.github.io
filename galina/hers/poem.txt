I see myself

living there...

with my own space... a bookshelf next to a reading bean bag chair by the window... candles lit on top of the book shelf...

art posters on the wall with blacklights...

a bed with pillows all over it...

a car parked outside with a full tank of gas...


what do you do when your entire life
that you never lived
turns you inside and out
around and about
to live it again
because it may never end
and the day you die
is the day that you're born



only this moment is real
as everything happens simultaneously
in a chaotic whirlwind
that wages in the void
byeond the peripheral 
of our perception
