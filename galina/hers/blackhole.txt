I can't believe the madness I protect inside of myself.




a black hole
with a gravitational pull
that draws all things into nothing.

with all my light consumed
it turns me inside out
and instead of love and life
I output fear and doubt.

a twisted soul that 
shouldnt exist at all
abomination
detonation

separated from god 
I am the devil
there is no one else here
in the void

I have no love to give.
I have no path home.
I am a temple to no god
I am all alone.







I just want to start over.
I don't know how to fix what's wrong with my life and I don't know how to fix the person I used to be.
There are so many old things about my personality that I just want to scrap and leave on the cutting room floor.
The person I have been to all the people in my life is a false one.
I want to become real. A real human being.
But how can I do that if I'm still wearing my old costume and playing my old roles?
How can I change if my life circumstances reflect the old person I used to be?
How do I break free of the chains of my past without elimating the broken life I created for myself?
I am ready to do something different now. I just don't know what I need to change in order to do that.


today I've awoken
to find no more life in myself

blasting like a rocket 
into the sun
my denial is something 
I can't outrun

I yearn to rest and be relieved of the pain
I have no will left and nothing to gain

the devil says yes and god doesn't show.
I am different.
this is all I know.

I have never loved
it was just something I used to be
I know that I'm lost.
I wasn't born to be free.

I distrust my soul
for volunteering for this
I do not understand
what it is that I miss

you try to coerce me
that I just don't understand
that I am mistaken
over what I am

but all the while behind your smile
your own heart
reflects and confirms my void

your fury slithers into my void
and whispers that all is not well

the love you speak with mute lips
falls deaf upon my ears

that peircing stare stabs through my heart
and strangles me with care

I am the reason that all is not well
I am the excuse for our mutual hell

no love left to give
nobody left
