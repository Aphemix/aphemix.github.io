stop being the played and be the player.

does my inner life make me mad?

heaven lies in this mind


wwrite a song about the mundanity and mindlessnes sof day to day conversation. everyone is just ants.



multidimensional people have so many different moods to express their being.

you gaze into my multidimensional soul
and your eyes lock onto a corner
you take my heart felt words
and turn them into your fodder


I want to stab a fleshy canvas 
and call the bloody mess art.

wanna destroy this life in a whirlwind
smash it into pieces and 
exterminate every last part



I know I'm turning away from truth. 
I know I'm walking the wrong path. 
But that's.. that's not me.. I'm being lead 
blindfolded by some psychopath
