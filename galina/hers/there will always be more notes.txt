I'd like to master the ability to be alone.


I've had this strange thought that my metaphorical seeking mind is an attempt to mimic the manifesting and morphing nature of reality. There's truth in the transformation of concepts beyond what they seek to explain. There's truth in the process in which it all comes to be.

The process of transforming thoughts, observations, and metaphors mimics the true creative and morphing nature of reality.
