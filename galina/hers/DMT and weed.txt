I'm pretty sure that cannabis has a unique effect on me because of all the other psychedelics I've (ab)used. When I first started smoking weed in my teens, it was an experience that could be summed up by all the cliche prior posts in this thread.

But after spending a year dabbling in research chemicals and real world life changing experiences, the effect is entirely different. I should probably start by mentioning that I've smoked over a gram of 5-meo-DMT to myself in that time. Overboard? Yes. I don't want to hear it. After all, I wouldn't do it again. I was fascinated by it's effects and I would take consequentially bigger and bigger hits to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. That practice alone changed me in ineffable ways that go without saying.

Anyway, back to cannabis. I went a very long period without smoking any weed at all. The entire period that was devoted to other drugs was completely void of it. As life teaches you things, you learn them and stop beating a dead horse. I stopped using psychedelics. I just didn't need/want to any more.

I love weed. I always have. So when the opportunity arose for me to start smoking again, I noticed very peculiar changes in effects on me. As I got high, it wasn't the old munchies and giggles that it used to be - although those weren't gone.

I can have thoughts so intricate and profound, they would overload my head and inhibit my real world functioning. It's as though I'm tapping into a networked understanding possessed by my higher consciousness. 

5-meo-DMT flashbacks are a common byproduct as well and can be set off by something as simple as a change in my blood pressure when I stand up after sitting. They're overwhelming and they take me somewhere else spiritually, while my mind and body are still able to function somewhat normally but separately.
