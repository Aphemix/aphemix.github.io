Captain's Log: Februrary 26th 6:24am

Sleep has become temporarily impossible. Certain anxieties that took seed throughout my day have welled up within me to blossom in these late hours. Anxiety is definitely a flower that thrives in darkness. Today has been one of a slew of activities.. upon waking I biked to the store to get cigarettes and once home eventually ate 280 or so mg of DXM. I'm not sure how successful this mission was but considering I had no purpose in mind and it inspired a few things, it couldn't be considered a failure. For a considerable amount of time, I was sick from it. Towards the end though, after having talked with Mike and having my phone die I sat outside for a few at the pool area smoking a cigarette before getting up to walk home. The thoughts I had were refreshing.. and went so far as to be simply bold and say that..

"EVERYTHING IS OKAY!"

When I got back I said



triXyblaKe (12:19:21 AM): and had this blatant cool epiphany.. that really isn't news to me, especially lately but..

triXyblaKe (12:20:51 AM): just the fact that everything is good. the same feeling I had right after rolling while I was experiencing the afterglow. the days after that.. I got sick and kinda didn't do anything and just felt kinda blah...
amp hates you (12:21:57 AM): everything is good.
amp hates you (12:21:57 AM): :-)
triXyblaKe (12:23:02 AM): yes :-) I know. there's a difference for me personally from just knowing it as a fact.. and really being involved in believing it and experiencing the awesomeness.. and my mission is to make that fact present every fucking day of my life
amp hates you (12:23:30 AM): yeah there's definitely a difference to me too
amp hates you (12:23:38 AM): but as long as one is true the other is possible y'know
triXyblaKe (12:24:16 AM): the fact energizes me and inspires me when I'm really in it's presence.. you know what I mean? it's like being closer to life
amp hates you (12:24:38 AM): oh yes.
triXyblaKe (12:24:51 AM): and I want to be like that all the fucking time.
triXyblaKe (12:24:58 AM): seriously.
triXyblaKe (12:25:11 AM): I want to be in love with you and life.. for as long as I live.
amp hates you (12:26:31 AM): you are! And you will be.
amp hates you (12:26:50 AM): what you do about it is totally seperate from the fact and will detract from nothing.
triXyblaKe (12:27:32 AM): what do you mean by "what you do about it"?
amp hates you (12:28:06 AM): well maybe i put it poorly
triXyblaKe (12:28:39 AM): also, I'm kinda ya'know.. speaking in my second language.. so if you want to put it differently, that'd be cool
amp hates you (12:29:38 AM): what i mean is you know better, and you feel it genuinely, regardless...and how you handle it and develop it can be executed however you end up executing it and it'll still be...everything it already is
amp hates you (12:29:46 AM): I don't know, I'm confusing myself
amp hates you (12:29:53 AM): I just mean nothing can stop you.
triXyblaKe (12:30:01 AM): I got you :-)
triXyblaKe (12:30:03 AM): <3
triXyblaKe (12:30:06 AM): <333
amp hates you (12:30:11 AM): <3 !!!
triXyblaKe (12:30:12 AM): blah /cheesy
amp hates you (12:30:14 AM): :-)
triXyblaKe (12:30:16 AM): but yeah
triXyblaKe (12:30:17 AM): <3
triXyblaKe (12:30:53 AM): I feel way more lucid.. still deliciously loopy.. but earlier tonight I felt just kinda zombie like and inarticulate - even to myself. but yeah, that's gone and I still feel cool :-)
amp hates you (12:31:11 AM): good, good
amp hates you (12:32:16 AM): man
amp hates you (12:32:22 AM): i wanna give you a hug or somethin
triXyblaKe (12:32:50 AM): I just don't want to waste any more of my life than absolutely necessary not appreciating how amazingly beautiful everything is and how satisfying being alive can be with all it's possibilities... 
amp hates you (12:33:10 AM): lol.......yeah i totally feel ya
triXyblaKe (12:33:47 AM): we're soooooo young. and that makes me happy.
amp hates you (12:34:13 AM): oh yes.
triXyblaKe (12:34:47 AM): I feel like I won the lottery. I'm 18 and what?! I have it all figured out!? word!
amp hates you (12:35:08 AM): lmao
amp hates you (12:35:12 AM): yeah I'm with ya :-)
triXyblaKe (12:35:25 AM): if you just take a look around, those thoughts are SO valid
amp hates you (12:35:31 AM): no shit!
amp hates you (12:35:36 AM): I've been having them for years!
triXyblaKe (12:35:42 AM): :-)
triXyblaKe (12:35:50 AM): can't believe
triXyblaKe (12:35:56 AM): the evolution of ourselves and our relationship
triXyblaKe (12:36:00 AM): seriously, wtf is that
amp hates you (12:36:03 AM): yeah it's insane
triXyblaKe (12:36:34 AM): I am NOT the same girl you met over a year ago.
amp hates you (12:36:48 AM): it feels particularly insane to me just because of, I dunno, how fucking unexpected it is in context with what I previously thought was possible
amp hates you (12:37:05 AM): well you are in all the good ways fyi.
triXyblaKe (12:37:13 AM): *nods* :-)
triXyblaKe (12:37:18 AM): on both counts
amp hates you (12:37:43 AM): I'm sure it's outstandingly drastic for you, unprecedented change etc.
amp hates you (12:37:52 AM): but it's quite drastic for me in a totally different way
triXyblaKe (12:38:11 AM): yeah, I can totally see that
triXyblaKe (12:38:27 AM): psst
amp hates you (12:38:29 AM): yo
triXyblaKe (12:38:32 AM): you inspire me :-)
amp hates you (12:38:59 AM): you inspire me!
triXyblaKe (12:39:24 AM): oh shit
triXyblaKe (12:39:30 AM): we're stuck in an infinite loop
triXyblaKe (12:39:51 AM): eventually we're just going to explode when our awesomeness/ultimateness reaches .... terminal velocity
amp hates you (12:40:02 AM): explode into light basically
amp hates you (12:40:15 AM): but yeah...i dunno man
triXyblaKe (12:40:15 AM): oh!
amp hates you (12:40:18 AM): ...sup?
triXyblaKe (12:40:28 AM): I don't think I mentioned this but earlier I hallucinated a hypercube.
triXyblaKe (12:40:34 AM): but anyway, were you going to say something :-)
amp hates you (12:41:11 AM): yeah...
amp hates you (12:41:17 AM): i just feel like...
amp hates you (12:42:26 AM): you and the role you've played in my life really are quite literally the missing pieces to whatever puzzle i am...and I've never had one of those before
amp hates you (12:42:52 AM): and not only that...it's like wow...this isn't just a puzzle
amp hates you (12:42:59 AM): it's a fucking door drawn on the wall with chalk
amp hates you (12:43:32 AM): i dunno, I'm just going off
triXyblaKe (12:43:42 AM): :-)
amp hates you (12:43:46 AM): i just cannot express the significance
amp hates you (12:43:48 AM): can't do it
amp hates you (12:43:49 AM): lol
triXyblaKe (12:43:54 AM): no, but I got your hints
triXyblaKe (12:43:57 AM): and my imagination :-)
triXyblaKe (12:44:20 AM): and... I'm just glad I'm not the only one ;-)
amp hates you (12:44:27 AM): yeah...and you've seen it in action so I'm sure somewhere in there you know what I'm talking about
triXyblaKe (12:44:38 AM): oh dude, I do.
amp hates you (12:44:44 AM): heheh
amp hates you (12:44:47 AM): it's great
triXyblaKe (12:44:48 AM): I know exactly what you're talking about.
triXyblaKe (12:45:15 AM): we are round characters in a 2D world, baby
amp hates you (12:45:21 AM): hahaa
amp hates you (12:45:24 AM): oh yes.
triXyblaKe (12:46:07 AM): {happy sigh}
amp hates you (12:46:12 AM): :-)
triXyblaKe (12:48:24 AM): it's weird.. 
triXyblaKe (12:23:02 AM): yes :-) I know. there's a difference for me personally from just knowing it as a fact.. and really being involved in believing it and experiencing the awesomeness.. and my mission is to make that fact present every fucking day of my life

when I was talking about this.. I guess what it comes down to is me talking about being .......happy. but I put it in all these weird ways because I'm not happy about stupid shit like having lots of things.. or trivial stupid 2d happiness.. I really mean like.. existential happiness. thats the only kind thats really valid to me.
amp hates you (12:49:02 AM): me the fuck too!
amp hates you (12:49:14 AM): this is a dilemma i understand very well.
triXyblaKe (12:49:49 AM): lately I've been having this weird idea that my being alive feels like a constant religious experience.... it's totally not intellectual.. it reminds me of this buddhist quote that goes "one who is enlightened is in a state of constant amazement"
amp hates you (12:50:41 AM): haha
triXyblaKe (12:51:00 AM): I just feel like I've woken the fuck up and I'm amazed at the fact that I was sleeping through all this NOISE.
triXyblaKe (12:51:45 AM): at this point I'm just talking about wtfever is on my mind btw :-) I don't really have any important points to get across.. just... ahhhhh.. rambly
amp hates you (12:51:57 AM): i don't even know what to say to any of this, either, but i love hearing it
triXyblaKe (12:52:13 AM): oooh!
amp hates you (12:52:16 AM): i feel like i could compare hearing it to uh...being enthused about my favorite sports team kicking ass or something
