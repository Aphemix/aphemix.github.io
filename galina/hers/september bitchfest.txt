I decided I couldn't sleep so I ate tylenol pm. concluded, anyway. what a fucking whirlwind. the beautiful thing is that I don't care what happens to him. it's not my responsibilty. I'm no longer the person that he was with... he can talk to whoever, do whatever, be whatever. it doesn't matter. I still can't believe the things that Josh said to me on the phone... but again.. he wasn't saying them to me. he was saying them to himself... as fucking sad as that is.

I'm one of the few people who will ever ever truly know myself. Richard. when I look into his eyes, there's something there that takes a hold of me, that doesn't let me look away. I can stare him down until we fall into eachother. that kind of brutal honesty is hard to find, to say the least. the lack of sugarcoating, the pure expression of what is happening that very moment between the two of you... it's breahttaking. it's unbelievable. it's the universe telling you that you've done something right. that you deserve the path you were born to walk down and all really is true, good, and peaceful. I wish everybody could feel this way. I wish I could've held my past self, soothed my past pains, murmured "it's okay"s to my nightly tears. I wish I couldve wrapped a warm blanket around my anxiety, my insecurities, my sad state of self. I feel so much compassion towards myself with understanding and attachment these days. I truly understand what it is to be myself and admire that being from the distance of the observer. and I'm sorry, I wish I couldve done more for my position in the universe at the time. because it's our obligation to nurture ourselves, it's our born right to find happiness and deserve what we need. we are all born innocent.

we are all born free. then the sickness enters our naive eyes and this god given life turns into somebody elses projection of the madness which surrounds us all. we are all in it, a part of it, a gear, a lever. what can we do?
