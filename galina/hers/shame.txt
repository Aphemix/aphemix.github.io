where to start where to start where to start....

the contents of my head feel like the digested stomach contents of an autopsied body that died from being poisoned. through the mess, the examiner, (my introspective self), tries to sift through the evidence that's been ravaged and contaminated by my stomach acid. what could've caused the sickness that put my health under? it's an organic puzzle, and there may not just be one culprit, but a culmination of effects that together create a new and even harder to identify ailment.

feeling #1-10: I don't want to be a slave to my past.

there are lingering discontents and insecurities that make me second guess the goodness that comes into my life today and these demons have no place in my soul any more. I feel like I've paid my dues through suffering, yet it feels like I need to pay even more for allowing myself to suffer so. there's an entrapping thought loop of guilt and shame.

feeling #2: I no longer want to feel ashamed.



I'm going to perform an experiment of monitering and encouraging myself over the next couple hours. I'm going to listen to all my thoughts and feelings and if I feel the need to, record them in order to observe them. There are deep inward processes that have developed and strengthened over time and only I can disable them. I must stop looking outside of myself.




I want to reconnect with the child I used to be. By shuffling my memories off to the side, I act as though they had never happened.... because I am ashamed of them. They don't fit together with my concept of myself and my life, so I discarded them aside. But with nothing left in their place, the void that creates is filled with the only substance that will fit. Shame. Guilt. All is not well.

I am ready to address this.
This is my own personal journey and I can't take it with anybody else. It's time to take responsibility for it and it's all I can do. This is my new purpose.

Moving on... and all that it will take.

I know that my childhood is largely responsible for all the difficulty I've experienced in my life and I can avoid it no longer. It's influenced my self image, my choices, and the ways in which I react to all things; good or bad. The inconsistencies are what is keeping me from being and embodying my true self.

From a very young age, I felt discontent but the worst of it all started when I changed schools in grade 5. I went from a family and compassion driven environment to an alien and shallow environment where I was judged mercilessly for my differences. 


# feeling insecure about my appearance #
Even before I changed schools in grade 5, I dealt with feelings of not belonging or fitting in, wanting to lose weight and be skinny like the girls around me. It wasn't as bad as it would become, but I had to deal with the odd asshole kid here and there for judging me or ridiculing me for being slightly overweight. I remember trying to plan out diets for myself which consisted of hardly any food whatsoever and then punishing myself inwardly with shame for not being able to control myself and adhere to my plans. It didn't help that my mother judged me for it either, and would make comments about my appearance to my dad for buying me a treat now and then. It only got worse as I aged and sought consolation from the environment around myself when I couldn't heal my own feelings. And cruelly, my peers took out their own insecurities upon me to make me feel even worse. When I went to school down in Florida after we moved, I was at the age where I started to seek approval from the opposite sex. Even when I got it, it was never the right kind, and only the negative influences would stick and affect me. This only furthered my condition, and inconsideration of myself. 

Was it my fault? I have to conclude that despite my feelings at the time, it wasn't. It was a cause and effect culmination of experiences, and the world around me was cruel. Can I blame it? no... that much is life. But what I can do is understand that I no longer need to feel that way. I never deserved to feel that way. Beauty is a subjective thing, and it's not my purpose to fulfill any ideals outside of my own which are nourishing my body and treating it healthily like the temple that it is. Regardless of what I look like, my body is a beautiful thing. And on the shallow level of it all, most people would say I'm far too superficially beautiful to feel this way anyway. But I can make a gift out of my ego smashing, and turn it into a beautiful selflessness.

# my parents inconsiderations of my personhood #
I believe this to be the one most damaging wound of all. it began with the inconderation of my own experience, by ignoring the pain I felt at the time as a necessary or unimportant casualty. before my parents even decided to move to Florida, I was treated as if I was insignificant. my parent's problems were reflected into my view, and I could do nothing. my father would tell me of his despair how my mother didn't care to be home with either him or I, and would rather pretend as though we didn't even exist by becoming a workaholic. this alone was a testament to how unimportant we both were, and I could only feel bad about it. my parents never understood how sensitive I was and would do things (such as peddle off my pets to be killed by my brother) while ignoring my cries and confessions of feeling. 

upon moving to florida, my family was dealing with so much by themselves that all of my own personal difficulties with the transformation were completely ignored. I was scared and isolated, with nobody to talk to. we started out staying with the zeigleheims and I couldn't not notice the contrast of our families, and myself to their girls. it mirrored how I felt in relation to almost all of the other girls I met and dealt with once I started going to school. they were all creatures of materialistic perfection, which on some level I idolized and tried to mimic, if only so I didn't stick out like a sore thumb... vulnerable. the last thing I felt I needed was to be unique or different, as it was a weakness if noticed. it wouldn't do me good.

my home life was broken. it would be too generous to say it was still in the process of falling apart. with my dad gone out of the country, my mom had free reign to manage the situation at home, and she failed miserably. she would take out her anguish on her children, and I think I experienced the worst of it being the youngest and the only girl. my parents love for me mutated into a constant battle of suspicion of my wrongdoing. I made mistakes here and there, but no punishment was enough. they withheld their love for me, and judged me without end. I was wrong and they admitted that they never would trust me... I was alone. I was rarely rewarded or praised and I was raised through negativity at this point and onwards. the situation was only compounded a thousand times worse once I left school because I was too miserable to function. my daily existence at home became a battle every day not to give up. at points I counted down the days until I turned 18, in hope that one day, I could be okay with living my life.

my feelings were constantly invalidated to the point of my suicide attempts being trivialized.
