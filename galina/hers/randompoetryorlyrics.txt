today I wanted to be happy
cheap pleasures in high demand

but this idealistic bullshit
never goes as planned

painting pictures to look at it 
but theres no colored crayons.

black and white blueprints
scribbled all over your hands

I thought I wanted the truth
but I guess you never really know yourself

whatever firey energy that makes us all tick
only to someday burn out leaving us lifeless dolls
dressed up by children for ceremonies.
