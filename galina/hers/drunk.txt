I wish this song applied to you.

Today I captured the idea of a "future thought". A thought I have before the time I'd accept it, (the future or never), but one that rings true uncomfortably long. I just can't bare to look at it. It hurts my eyes, it makes me want to cry. That's as I remember correctly, anyway.. I've trained myself to avoid it by all means no matter what. there are just some thoughts I refuse to allow into my own personal philsophy.... and i am such a broken person because of it. so torn, in pieces, in fucking shreds. 

the good intention was to never hurt. 

it's all a tragic comedy. humor never escapes the brevity's clutches. life is the grand inside joke.. I only wish I had someone to truly share it with.... but who would I trust? WHO the fuck would I trust? with my soul unless I could see right through them and decipher their every motion of infatuation, love, and commitment.. and I would belittle it to the facts, saying that yes, "this is safe".. 'they don't even have the capacity to harm me or even think the thought'.. I'm okay. is security that important? do you not know that you'll never ever ever have that security in another human being? (maybe theyll have a good track record.. but how could it ever be guaranteed??) the only person you can ever trust is yourself, babe...


basically I "slipped" and called him out on his "cheap charms which could influence anyone"



Do I ever really believe any of this? I operate within the vicinity of this relationship without actually believing in it. You decide what you believe in. Fears are just unresolved responses and reflexes.



March 9th, 2007-

Addressing my deepest fears that obstruct me from living my life:

Fear of being nothing.. nothing at all. Related: being boring or worthless next to my own standards.

My own standards? They're a guideline to living when there should just be life. It's a pursuit that will never be actualized. All this preoccupation with being a certain way or living up to a certain standard is the road block that will forever hold me back from just being and understanding myself as exactly the way that I am. I am alive. I am conscious and ever changing, ever growing and transforming. I am not just a mish mash of stimulations and simulations as far as my own life and experience is concerned. I don't have to do anything. I want my life to be a joyous celebration of everything as it is.

Ahhhh.. don't you feel better now? Thankyou Krishnamurti. Thank you for teaching me how to think. 



such extremeties I have.


I want to nose dive into nothingness, dissolve into everything, and never wash back up on shore.








ComedyOfExistenz (9:12:23 PM): The Book of Disquiet is the book I was hoping for when I started Solipsist
ComedyOfExistenz (9:12:31 PM): aight
ComedyOfExistenz (9:12:42 PM): have a good bath of disquiet!
ComedyOfExistenz (9:13:02 PM): is that what you're gonna read? BoD? or the poems?
triXyblaKe (9:13:09 PM): BoD :-D
ComedyOfExistenz (9:13:13 PM): awesome
ComedyOfExistenz (9:13:58 PM): there's a lot more rage in Solipsist, as I've said. their agendas and temperaments are vastly different..

Auto response from triXyblaKe (9:13:58 PM): there is no time for you to steal from the truth

ComedyOfExistenz (9:15:10 PM): Rollins has a tendency to go on these obnoxious misanthropic rants about society which aren't as funny as he thinks they are. they can be off-putting or depressing, or reek of a certain insincerity
ComedyOfExistenz (9:15:34 PM): but there's still more than enough raw anguish and candor in Solipsist to make it worth reading
ComedyOfExistenz (9:15:46 PM): and he has his poetic moments
ComedyOfExistenz (9:16:39 PM): and it would still be interesting to compare the two books
ComedyOfExistenz (9:16:51 PM): I'm sure I'll be one of the few people in the world to have read both
ComedyOfExistenz (9:17:38 PM): nobody takes Henry Rollins very seriously, so he's never a subject for literary or academic discussion as far as I know, though at one time he was pretty popular
ComedyOfExistenz (9:19:07 PM): Pessoa should be taken more seriously than 99% of the bullshit the fills the bookshelves, but while respected and cherished by those who know of him (lucky souls like ourselves), he's still far from well-known enough to be the subject of much academic discussion outside of Portugal, or Europe generally
ComedyOfExistenz (9:21:19 PM): thus, were I to undertake such a project (comparing the two books), it'd surely be one of privileged originality
ComedyOfExistenz (9:22:07 PM): Pessoa can be misanthropic, but always in a gentle, absurd, funny way
ComedyOfExistenz (9:22:55 PM): Rollins's misanthropy is cynical and alienating, bitter, vitriolic, even murderous
ComedyOfExistenz (9:23:22 PM): I should read Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground
ComedyOfExistenz (9:23:56 PM): that might be an important precursor to something like Solipsist
ComedyOfExistenz (9:25:19 PM): in fact..
ComedyOfExistenz (9:25:39 PM): maybe I could do some comparative study on the topic of solitude in literature
ComedyOfExistenz (9:26:26 PM): if I'm not mistaken, Dostoevsky's underground man is yet another type of solitary, a vengeful, scheming, politically motivated, anarchic type
ComedyOfExistenz (9:27:05 PM): but I know little about that book
ComedyOfExistenz (9:27:12 PM): I've just seen passages here and there
ComedyOfExistenz (9:27:58 PM): I may have to return to one of my several books on solitude for something like this
ComedyOfExistenz (9:28:47 PM): I have Anthony Storr's Solitude: A Return to the Self, which I read in 2004
ComedyOfExistenz (9:29:00 PM): it was a solid book. satisfying, if a bit predictable

Auto response from triXyblaKe (9:29:00 PM): there is no time for you to steal from the truth

ComedyOfExistenz (9:29:36 PM): I've only read a fraction of Philip Koch's Solitude: A Philosophical Encounter, which looks more penetrating but also more unwieldy
ComedyOfExistenz (9:33:57 PM): I also have Anneli Rufus's The Loner's Manifesto, but I've barely read any
ComedyOfExistenz (9:56:11 PM): oh, I got this book free today: it was in the promo bin at work: http://www.amazon.com/Enigma-Our-Existence-Mystery-Destiny/dp/1561679496/ref=sr_1_1/104-5002875-9371114?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173408891&sr=1-1

Auto response from triXyblaKe (9:56:11 PM): there is no time for you to steal from the truth

ComedyOfExistenz (10:04:50 PM): brb, cigarette
