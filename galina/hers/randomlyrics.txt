Fear. Face the fear. Face it head on, look into fuckin oblivion. and then your free.
once you realise that you truly have nothing to lose (because nothing was ever yours)
the world dosn't seem so sick and cruel, now does it?

all these tools pretending they belong to eachother.. you have nothing, nothing, nothing
so treasure your dreams
cuz that's all that ever be your own





Ignore him. Fuck him! Arrrghhhh.... god. Get away, get away, get away. Stay thousands of miles away, stay distracted by sights. 

It dosn't make sense to care. So fuck'em.



rotating geers shift me into mode
perception twists and turns into a joke

you're not here but that's okay

because everything else is present

because the whole world is intact

I see your shadow on the wall
and it's ironic 
cause that's all you are afterall

the room is dark and empty
but I'm not alone......


dream up an entire world
to inhabit when I'm bored
epic stories to entertain me
what's funny in the end
is my life is my life is my life
