chess illustration

illustration of a king being checked on a board. all characters thoroughly brought to life with the dramatic scenario being animated emotively with leet perspective. queen and a knight with a pawn perhaps.

psychedelic pheonix rebirth

spectrum of the human soul

a meditative humanoid figure composed of pure light colors sitting in the lotus position, surrounded by mandala psychedelia. in the center of the chest, a perfect prism will be channeling all the light of the being into the spectrum of the human consciousness, with all it's colors and levels.a brilliant rainbow displaying the chaos of what it means to be human dominating the lower half of the picture. perhaps enveloping the planet and the pure light of being being chanelled from the spacely heavens above.

perhaps the light could enter the prism at an angle (to be correct via geometry) and circle out in a brilliant curve to circle the planet.

insanity

dude curled up in a fetal position while the world and scenary around him swirl hypnotically causing the picture to break like a mirror.

alien telepathy

a perspective piece. a psychedelic ufo above beaming down into the center piece of a person's mind.

the human mind stretched throughout the different layers of existence.... connected to their higher self. perhaps have a growing outline of their higher self, layers around the corpeal body.
