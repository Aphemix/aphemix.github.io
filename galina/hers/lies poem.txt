if you don't know where you want to go
you'll end up somewhere else

with people telling you their answers
that dont even apply to themselves

seeking the truth becomes your fallacy
an excuse to look away

you've had it all along
you just want it to go away

for a better world, for a better life,
this denial will become your strife

until you realize somewhere along the lines
somewhere inbetween the lies (you tell yourself)
you lost yourself.
