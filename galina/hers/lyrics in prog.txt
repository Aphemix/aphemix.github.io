My soul is a twister destroying the landscape of my mind. My emotions are the snakes that have me in a bind.

The time is ticking for this rollercoaster to end. But until that moment, I'm in it. I'm in it. It's I and I am in it. Twirl twirl twirl spin spin spin hurl hurl hurl you'll never win win win.


we grew up in a world where everything was fake
people talked about love but they really meant hate
we built ourselves out of their ruin, 
from scratch, from nothing
we will learn

we said "fuck the world"... we have eachother.
we dreamed to live our lives and die by suicide
and we thought that we knew better

amnesia is my waking state for the waking world
it was almost too late to figure out where to start
and each puzzle piece makes up a piece of my heart

my eyes, glazed over, let in the sun
my vision's gleamed over and I want to run
this perspective takes me out of this world
removing me from my body and inhabiting my soul
my existence is shaken and I am alive.
and its sucha strange life... what a strange life.

to live each day and become something new
was something I thought a person like me couldn't do.

my heart recedes to everybody's pleas
we're all in this together but I can't help you.

where's the balance, where's the check?
I hope I know tomorrow.
I just hope it makes sense next week.

"Sometimes I feel like my life is a rigged game, and the determining cards are seen only by the hands of the bluffing god betting away my reality."

my heart stops still but the world still spins
and I'm worried about losing everything

I'm an empty vessel transporting the joke of an ego
that is capable of inventing both good and evil

I'm the entire universe percieved in a timeless moment
my ego unravels and I become both one and zero


and I'm spiraling out of control down into my double helix soul

take the third toke

will we ever be allowed to be innocent?
