Yep! Many different locations but at all of them I've noticed the warm reception of the baristas and reliably quick service. I always dig the decoration and music playing as well - it tends to be tastefully stylish and relaxing but not overwhelming or distracting.


Everything there is to like about coffee! The smell, the taste, the caffeine (ofcourse), and all the delicious varieties.
 


It seems like the perfect job for me. I admire the standards I've read about on the website and I'm attracted to a job that can be both fast paced and laid back simultaneously. I'm a cheerful and upbeat person that's easy to get along with and I would thrive working in the Starbucks enviroment considering I love being around both coffee and people.
