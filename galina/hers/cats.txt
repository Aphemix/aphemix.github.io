"After spraying has begun, castration is still effective in stopping this behavior 
in 90% of male cats and 95% of female cats, regardless of age or experience."


Solving the CAT problem:

1. NEUTER THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS!
2. SEPERATE the cats in the house and start a slow reintroduction process.
3. CLEAN THE CARPET/HOUSE/ETC OF CAT URINE
4. USE MULTIPLE LITTER BOXES (3 or 4 in total). Buy new litter boxes and 
find something to put under them for carpeted areas. Keep the litterbox away 
from their food in the kitchen.

Mike needs to stop fucking with the cats in an aggressive manner because it causes stress. Cats can't be punished with physical discipline.
We want to discourage unacceptable behavior like aggression, and in order to do that, we have to eliminate our role in those behaviors.

Don't try to punish the cats involved. Punishment is likely to elicit further aggression and fearful responses, which will only make the problem worse.

Cats feel safe in high places.
