I can't believe it took me to this day
to realize you can never save me

and I don't think you would intimately understand. and it's just one more of my life's experiences falling on deaf ears and echoed back into meaningless.


whatever makes me happy
whatever occupies my.. time
I've come to believe that
all meaning is subjective
(so why have any at all)
are you going to surprise me
and validate my existence?
(why am I even here at all)

I can't believe I have one of those days
every single fuckin day

I can't believe I haven't flipped out
but that's just because this is how everything is
I can't believe I don't even know why
I persistently live for all of this

spend my whole life searching for that reason
I irrationally know exists.. 
trying to prove it every second
getting sick of my motives

so we just chill the fuck out 
we laugh on the sidelines
we give up to a degree
and anesthetize ourselves

revel in the irony that.. we can only be
when we pretend we dont exist

I never thought I would burn out.......
I thought I was made for life
but something else calls to me
so farewell and goodbye






you are you
and I am I
and we will never be
what I had in mind

thousand of miles
seperate our souls
and only our imagination
could communicate across
these endless canyons

in the end we're
just fantasies to one another
and does it matter if it's true,
if it's real
if in the end
(considering) 
everything you believe 
is all there is.



I'm tired, I can't talk anymore
too tired to think
to exhausted to act

it hurts when your world comes crashing down
almost as much as realizing its never been real


you are not a productive machine. if you are to appear to be, it will be a matter of pretending.


Tonight I sleep disturbed.

do you believe him? why?



you crave my essence
my constant reassurance that life is beautiful and that youre okay
but why does this have to destroy me?
but why does this have to destroy me?
I'm not okay. I'm not okay,

we're positive and negative,
except that we don't fit
