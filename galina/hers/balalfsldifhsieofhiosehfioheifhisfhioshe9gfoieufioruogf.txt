why are you reading this?

My goal in life is to become more conscious every single day. What else are we here to do? Some might testify with their cookie cutter lives that we're here to dwindle in our conditioned environments and lower the bar of the human condition. Our world is in ruin, on the edge of an inevitable transformation. For the better or for the worse... only time will tell. All I know is that I'm going to live on the edge of what could only be the evolution of humanity, and if you're interested in communicating, sharing, or wasting time along the way keeping these things in mind... rock on.

 and that's to love each other and make the world that much more beautiful every day. I love to have star-gazing conversations and midnight adventures. I want to find more people to share music with because it's the one thing I cannot go a day without enjoying. most important of all, I abhor close mindedness and only want to be around fellow life adventurers.




I feel really good after yesterday. I talked for a while and even though I didn't slam dunk on all of the important and epic things going on inside of me, the act of experiencing my higher thought process and awareness brought me back to that level where I feel confident in everything I'm doing. and what am I doing? I'm not even entirely sure because this whole time, I've been so preoccupied by reacting. And that's a wonderful picture to paint of the contrast I feel between these two states. It's the difference between being in a reactive state where reality decides for you what you experience, and being in an active creation state where your experience is manifested by yourself and for yourself. Reality is the minor stimuli.

You are in control of your consciousness. You deam responsibility for all of your thoughts and all of your feelings. You aren't afflicted by them. You are them. They aren't the other, the banished, the dissapproved. It's integration. It's the dream you had as a child of one piece ajar in a complex machine that brings the entire process to a halt. The dream was so abstract that it couldn't be related to anything other than the conflict between consciousness and personhood.

I think it's about time that I go back to florida when I do. I have things to do, tasks ahead of me. I need to go off on my expedition and learn how to be alone and successful in all the things I do. It's an experience that will empower me, because it will become me. I know this is what I need. I don't know how difficult of a time I'm going to have, but if I can preserve this mindstate and not give into fear, it will be intensely growth inspiring. 

When I can see the light that is my enlightenment, I feel so thankful for my struggle. This is.... what it's all about. This is the concentrated form of what other unfortunate people have to deal with drawn out over their entire lives with no resolution. My old self died on the cross so that I could be forgiven for my sins. And I'm so thankful.... because when you glimpse the light that is existential bliss, it is so incredibly worth it and can not be imagined by the unenlightened mind. It hits you like a hit of DMT. 

Feeling true responsibility for your life isn't burdensome, it's pleasurable. You become the godlike architect of your existence. Nobody can control me or pursuade me to do anything I don't please to do. I call all of the shots. This is what self actualization feels like.

Mmm.. car. I can't wait to have that car. Freedom.

just remember to keep going.

nothing can stop you. the key is knowing this and embodying it. there is always a right thing to do and a perfect way to be in accordance with life around you.

I feel so irritated right now and I keep reasoning myself backwards itno a corner. I think I'm thinking too much and the answer must be incredibly simple. Thinking too much in the beginning is a problem because when I run out of positivity, I resort to negative thinking to fill the quiet voids; a part of myself doesn't want to be at peace. where do I go from here? my instant answer is to accept it. to allow it to be and just let it be. allow it to rise and not rise to the occasion of it.

on some level, I'm humoring these thoughts and feelings. I give them energy and they're hurting me from the inside out like a poison. you kill these thoughts the same way you kill advertisements. you ignore them. they're not worth your time.
