belief: that I'm lazy. (I am believed this for a second before I decided I actually felt like writing this).
that I could be unloveable: impossible! EVERYTHING is lovable eitherwise it wouldn't exist. you don't need to worry about safety. this fear doesn't even exist. it's an endlessly repeated abstraction.

you have to be able to realize that you want it. do not be led astray. there is only darkness there.
