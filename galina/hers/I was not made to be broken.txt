the temptation of an entirely new life:

I could abandone all the broken things I've shared with people and start entirely afresh.

a clean slate. 

I need to become a different person. this is imperative. right fucking now. and if you ask me, yes, I know why.

I need to learn. I need to be whole. I was not made to be broken.

i

ts imperative that I shed my shell


{
my ego's limits 
and my subconsciousness' limericks
will only lead me down the path
to do what must be done

remembering is learning.
learning is remembering.

a timeless soul
trapped into a temporal role
is only to fulfill a purpose
}

humans aren't made to be broken.
people are made to be broken vessels
for the innocent souls

we weren't born broken.
