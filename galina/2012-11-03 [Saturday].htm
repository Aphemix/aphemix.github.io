Suddenly I can be trusted, suddenly I can trust myself to use all I have to be conscientious rather than exploitative, to see what is good, to be led prudently into conducive circumstance rather than merely following chains of cause and effect in my imagination for fun. Seriously, it changes my whole freakin' life, it's the whole other side of a coin. Like when I went to Tampa. Quit smoking easily. Exercised. Knew what was good. Like that.
